## 1. Policy Statement
Trianz provides users with the facilities and opportunities to work remotely as appropriate. All users who work remotely must be aware of the acceptable use of computer devices and remote working opportunities. The policy emphasizes both Information Security and HR Practices to be followed during remote work.

## 2. Purpose
- To formalize the remote working policy for associates authorized to work from home for legitimate business or personal reasons (e.g., health, maternity).
  - If the associate is on a billable project, requisite client approvals are mandatory.
- To establish Information Security Compliance and business requirements standards for the use of Trianz and client IT information assets in a teleworking environment.
  - Appropriate monitoring mechanisms must be implemented while associates work remotely.
  - Suitable IT assets with adequate security controls must be provided to enable safe and secure project/business work.
  - IT information assets and any information stored on various devices must be safeguarded according to client InfoSec requirements and Trianz InfoSec standards, subject to random audits every six months.

## 3. Scope
The Work from Home (WFH) Policy applies to:
- All applicable authorized Trianz associates.
- Client-approved contract employees using Trianz IT assets and facilities remotely from home.
- This policy is applicable only in India.

## 4. Legislation
There is no specific legislation regarding remote work; however, associates are bound by the aspects laid out in this document as a corporate reference.

## 5. Definition of Work from Home
- Working from Home is defined as the capability for associates to work from a location within India, apart from designated Trianz or client offices, using Trianz assets and equipment for a prolonged duration.
- Requisite manager approvals are mandatory to work from home. Decisions regarding remote work must be made on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the manager or Trianz management, ensuring compliance with all statutory guidelines and policies.

## 7. Remote Working / Work From Home

1. **Approval Requirement**: Associates wishing to work from a remote location must obtain prior agreement from their line manager. Retrospective requests will not be accepted, and any absence may be deemed unauthorized, potentially leading to disciplinary action.

2. **Client Approval**: If the associate is on a project that requires client approval for remote work, the reporting manager must obtain this approval before the work from home request is approved.

3. **Business Requirement**: Line managers must ensure there is a clear business need for the associate to work remotely instead of from the office. For example, remote work may be justified if it allows the associate to focus on a specific task without daily distractions.

### Guidelines for Approving Requests for Working from Home

Line managers should consider the following criteria when evaluating requests from associates:

- **Job Nature**: Determine if the associate's job requires regular face-to-face contact, making remote work unsuitable.
  
- **Skills and Performance**: Assess the associate's skills, abilities, and past performance to decide if they can work unsupervised effectively.
  
- **IT Dependencies**: Exclude associates who depend on organizational IT assets that they do not possess from the policy.
  
- **Team Impact**: Evaluate the potential impact on the associate's colleagues and ensure sufficient resources are available to cover the associate's absence.
  
- **Home Location Suitability**: Ensure the associate's home environment is secure and meets the documented checklist, verified by the line manager before approval.
  
- **Medical Appointments**: Requests for remote work coinciding with medical appointments are allowed if there is a clear business benefit.
  
- **Flexi-time Recording**: Associates on flexi-time must record hours worked at home in the attendance tracking system.
  
- **Request Renewal**: All work from home requests must be reinitiated by the associate every three months and re-approved by the manager, unless changes are made by Trianz management based on criticality. Managers can revoke work from home privileges with two days' notice.

### Expectations of Associates Who Work from Home

- Associates must engage in agreed Trianz work and remain contactable during regular business hours.
