guidelines & Policies.
Whether or not an associate is permitted to work remotely is entirely at the discretion of Trianz.
Working from a remote location is neither a contractual nor a statutory right and Trianz is under
no obligation to approve a request by an associate to work remotely.

Ver.: 1.00

Associates wishing to work from a remote location must secure the agreement of their line
manager prior to the actual date. Retrospective requests will not be agreed and any absence
maybe considered as unauthorised, which may lead to disciplinary actions against the associate.
If the associate is on a project requiring client approvals for work from home due to the nature of
the project, approvals from the client is mandatory and should be sought by the reporting
manager prior to the approval of the work from home request.
When approving requests, the line managers are responsible for ensuring that there is a clear
business requirement for the associate to work remotely rather than working from office. An
example would be the associate benefiting from working on a specific task without the normal
daily distractions.

Guidelines for approving requests for working from home

Line managers are advised to ensure that deliverables and performance are tracked even while the
associate is working from a remote location. Managers should consider the below mentioned criteria
when the request is initiated by an associate.

The nature of the associate’s job: for instance, does the associate’s job require regular, face-toface contact with other associates or members of the public, meaning that it is unsuitable for the
post holder to work from home.
The applicant’s skills, abilities and personal attributes: The associate’s performance should be
considered in determining whether the associate is considered suitable to work unsupervised.
Associates having dependencies on organisational IT assets and are not in the possession of the
same must be excluded from the policy.
Impact to team: The demands likely to be placed upon the associate’s colleagues and impact
upon members of other teams with whom the associate works with. In other words, the line
manager needs to be confident that sufficient resources are available within the team to cover
the associate’s absence from work.
The suitability of home location: The suitability of the associate’s home location should also be
considered to ensure that for associates (both critical and non-critical), a secure working
environment is established as per the documented checklist and verified by the line manager
before approval of Work from Home request.
Requests for working from home which coincide with medical appointments are permitted,
however line managers should approve such requests where there is a clear business benefit for
associate to work at home rather than at the workplace.
For associates on flexi-time, any hours worked at home should be recorded on attendance
tracking system.
All work from home requests will have to be reinitiated by associate on a 3 monthly basis and
have to be re approved by managers unless otherwise Trianz management makes changes in the
said request based on criticality. It is at the discretion of the manager to revoke the work from
home at any point of time with an advance notice of 2 days.
