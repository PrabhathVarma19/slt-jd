3.7 Business Courtesy Rules
The conduct of Trianz management, professionals, associates and subcontractors and their respective
relationships with others involves important responsibilities. Doing business on a friendly basis with
organizations is desirable. Such relationships must be guided by the highest standards of personal
conduct and integrity as defined in “Legal and Ethical Conduct” and “Business Courtesy Rules.”
Favoritism, preferential treatment, and unethical business practices must be avoided. Trianz personnel
and subcontractors must avoid any conduct that might be misinterpreted by others or that might provide
a reason for questioning propriety.
These rules relate to accepting or granting of business courtesies, social amenities, gifts or favors. These
business courtesy rules apply to all Trianz associates and subcontractors in their relationships with
representatives and their families of organizations with which Trianz has a business relationship.
No associate may directly or indirectly accept from or provide to any representative of any organization
with which Trianz has a business relationship any gift or favor other than an ordinary business courtesy
or social amenity. No associate may solicit any gift or favor.
Rules Applicable to all Business Courtesies:
1. Business courtesies, social amenities, gifts and favors permissible under these rules must
• Not appear improper,
•

Only be offered or accepted in the ordinary course of generally accepted business conduct,

•

Not be frequent, lavish, or extravagant in nature.

2. Company associates and subcontractors may not use their own personal funds to provide business
courtesies, social amenities, gifts or favors that Trianz could not provide regardless of the source of
funds. It is the act of providing a prohibited courtesy, social amenity, gift or favor that is a violation,
not the source of funds.
3. A Company associate may provide or accept personal gifts from the associate’s family members who
may be associates of an organization doing business with Trianz. No associate or subcontractor may
seek reimbursement or use Company funds or resources to provide personal gifts.
4. In a competitive or other sensitive environment where impropriety can occur, gifts need to be avoided
except where it is customary and proper to give gifts, and the failure to provide or accept gifts would
appear as discourteous.
5. Reciprocity situations do arise. However, just because an associate of an organization with which
Trianz does business provides a business courtesy, social amenity, gift or favor to you, does not

Scope
The Work from Home (WFH) Policy applies to all applicable authorized Trianz associates and client
approved contract employees who use Trianz IT assets & facilities and equipment remotely from home.
The scope of this policy is applicable to India only.

location within India apart from the designated Trianz offices or Trianz client offices (referred to
as a ‘remote’ location subsequently), using Trianz assets and equipment, for a prolonged
duration.

•

decision pertaining to work remotely must be on a case-to-case basis based on discretion and
approval of the manager or Trianz management subject to meeting all statutory compliance
guidelines & Policies.

•

Working from a remote location is neither a contractual nor a statutory right and Trianz is under
no obligation to approve a request by an associate to work remotely.

Request to work remotely
•

All requests for working remotely must be in line with definition of “Remote working/Work from
Home” Policy as described above and must comply with the criteria stated above for meeting all
statutory compliance guidelines & Policies. All documentary evidence must be maintained
pertaining to remote working/work from home.

•

Associates wishing to work from a remote location must secure the agreement of their line
manager prior to the actual date. Retrospective requests will not be agreed, and any absence
maybe considered as unauthorized, which may lead to disciplinary actions against the associate.

•

If the associate is on a project requiring client approvals for work from home due to the nature
of the project, approvals from the client is mandatory and should be sought by the reporting
manager prior to the approval of the work from home request.

When approving requests, the line managers are responsible for ensuring that there is a clear
business requirement for the associate to work remotely rather than working from office. An
example would be the associate benefiting from working on a specific task without the normal
daily distractions.

Guidelines for approving requests for working from home
Line managers are advised to ensure that deliverables and performance are tracked even while the
associate is working from a remote location. Managers should consider the below mentioned criteria
when the request is initiated by an associate.
•

The nature of the associate’s job: for instance, does the associate’s job require regular, face-toface contact with other associates or members of the public, meaning that it is unsuitable for the

the same must be excluded from the policy.

•

Impact to team: The demands likely to be placed upon the associate’s colleagues and impact
upon members of other teams with whom the associate works with. In other words, the line
manager needs to be confident that sufficient resources are available within the team to cover
the associate’s absence from work.

•

The suitability of home location: The suitability of the associate’s home location should also be
considered to ensure that for associates (both critical and non-critical), a secure working
environment is established as per the documented checklist and verified by the line manager
before approval of Work from Home request.

•

Requests for working from home which coincide with medical appointments are permitted,
however line managers should approve such requests where there is a clear business benefit
for associate to work at home rather than at the workplace.

•

For associates on flexi-time, any hours worked at home should be recorded on attendance
tracking system.

•

All work from home requests will have to be reinitiated by associate on a three-month basis and
must be re approved by managers unless otherwise Trianz management makes changes in the
said request based on criticality. It is at the discretion of the manager to revoke the work from
home at any point of time with an advance notice of two days.

Performance Management
4.1 Introduction
Performance Management Process begins with setting goals. It is about aligning the organizational
objectives with the associates’ agreed measures, skills, competency requirements, development plans
and the delivery of results. It’s an ongoing, continuous process of monitoring, communicating,
prioritizing and measuring the set objectives. The emphasis is on improvement, learning and
development in order to achieve the overall business goals and to create a high performance workforce.
Thus, performance Management system contributes to the achievement of the organizational goals while
aiding individuals to increase their focus and effectiveness to gain clarity on their specific performance
objectives.

4.2 Objectives
Setting SMART (specific, measurable, Attainable, realistic and time bound) goals and conducting
performance evaluations/reviews at regular interval helps the performance management process in
many ways. The objectives of this process are as follows
•

To provide a structure for communication between the associates and the organization - on
aligning the organizational objectives with associates and their by aiding them to realize their
career objectives

•

Reiterating the organizational commitment towards retention of capable associates and
recognize quality performance and meritocracy

•

To provide continuous feedback and encouragement to the associates to perform well. Increase
two-way communication between supervisors and associates

TRIANZ CONFIDENTIAL

term and long-term goals
•

Provide the alignment for reward & recognition programs with individual performance.

Scope: All permanent full-time associates of Trianz.

4.3 Performance Management Process

is the first step towards performance management process. The processes are
•

Goal setting

Competency framework – competencies have been defined for each role in the organization.
We have defined competencies for 4 levels – Individual contributor, Leads, Managers and Senior
Leaders.

•

Rating – S, E, M, B and I

4.4 Goal setting process
Goals are motives and values that drive our behavior. Goals describe what the Individual and
organization would like to accomplish, or the business value the project will achieve. The goal provides
us direction and purpose. We set goals for all associates at the beginning of the fiscal year. Goals for
new entrants are set within a week of joining the organization. The reporting managers along with their
team members set goals not in isolation. We ideally set 4-5 SMART goals along with the measurement
criteria against each goal. The inputs for setting the goals are as follows:
•

Organizational objectives

•

Roles, responsibilities based on organization and project definition

•

Goals should help the individuals to realize the core competencies

On completion of this process, goals are signed off by the team member and the reporting manager.
These goals are reviewed through annual performance reviews.
Confirmation
TRIANZ CONFIDENTIAL

Page 40 of 63

All associates are deemed confirmed on the date of joining.
Project End Appraisals
Goals for all the project team members would be set by the designated project manager in the beginning
of the project. These goals would be reviewed and documented only by the project manager (PM) once
in a quarter or at the logical end of the project or when the team members are getting relieved from the
project. PM completes process by recording the accomplishment of the appraisee against the goals
set. The performance appraisal/review discussion does not take place in this process.

4.5 Annual Performance reviews
Performance appraisal is meant to summarize and evaluate an individual's overall performance for the
year. Performance of the appraisee is reviewed against the goals set and the competencies defined for
the level based on the associate’s roles and responsibilities. In this process overall rating for the
individual is arrived and discussed during the performance review discussion with the appraisee.
Developmental plan would be discussed during the performance review. The rating would be one of the
inputs for the decisions such as promotions, succession and strategic planning, and compensation
reviews etc.

4.6 Performance Improvement Plan
Associates whose performance needs improvement would be nominated for Performance Improvement
Plan (PIP). It is implemented, at the discretion of the reporting manager/BU head/functional head, when
it becomes necessary to help an associate to improve the associate’s performance. The Performance
Improvement Plan (PIP) is designed to facilitate constructive discussion between an associate and
associate’s supervisor and to clarify the work performance to be improved.
The process:
•

Appraiser in consultation with the BU head/human resource representative develops a plan,
timelines for measurement and the purpose of the activities or goals outlined to help the
associate to attain the desired level of performance.

•

Identify and specify the support and resources need to be provided to assist the appraisee.

•

Specify the timelines for the performance reviews.

•

State the level and consistency in performance expected by the appraisee and specify possible
consequences if performance standards are not met.

During the PIP period, appraisee would undergo three reviews (i.e. every 30days) by the associate’s
appraiser in consultation with the Reviewer and HR representative. In case an associate fails to meet
the required improvement plan, at the completion of the PIP period, appropriate decision will be
taken which could include further extension of PIP or separation.

total amount to be charged to associate’s personal account.
