1. Purpose and Objective
As Trianz transitions from a consulting and IT services company to an IP-led technology solutions and services
organization, fostering collaboration and synergy is of paramount importance. In-person interactions facilitate
stronger engagement, enhance teamwork, and drive business growth with focus and efficiency.
The objective of this Return to Office (RTO) Policy is to:
• Establish clear expectations, eligibility, and guidelines for employees returning to the physical workplace.
• Reinforce collaboration while maintaining organizational culture and business continuity.
• Balance operational efficiency with employee well-being through a structured hybrid work model.
While the flexibility of remote work is valued, the hybrid model ensures meaningful in-person interactions
while preserving the benefits of remote work.
2. Applicability
This policy applies to:
• All full-time, part-time, and contract employees, unless otherwise specified.
• Employees identified by their respective managers based on:
o Job functions
o Team collaboration requirements
o Business needs
Hybrid and remote work arrangements may be considered for roles that do not necessitate in-office
presence.
3. Expectations
• Office Attendance: Mandatory for a minimum of three (3) designated days per week.
• Work Hours: Employees must work nine (9) hours daily, including a one-hour lunch break.
• Scheduling & Roster Management:
a. Managers must provide a weekly attendance roster to optimize workspace utilization and enhance
team engagement.
b. Any changes to the assigned schedule require prior approval from the manager.
• Attendance Monitoring: Attendance data will be published weekly to the respective management teams.
4. Exceptions to RTO
Employees may qualify for an exception under the following circumstances:
• Critical Medical Conditions: Employees with documented critical medical conditions or disabilities
preventing them from returning to the office. The time for recuperation will be fixed and the exception will be
allowed for the specified duration with a ceiling of maximum 3 months from the date of launch of this policy.
• Caregiving Responsibilities: Employees responsible for immediate dependents with critical medical
conditions with limited alternative caregiving arrangements. The time for making alternate arrangements will

5. Process for Requesting an Exception
Employees seeking an exception must follow this process:

your manager before submitting it to HR. If your request doesn’t fall into the exception list, then it is highly
unlikely that the exception request will be approved. Any exception to this would need detailed justification with
the SLT and CHRO approval.

be applied.

communication.
