- The Company expects its directors and associates to exercise reasonable judgment in their business conduct.
- Associates are encouraged to refer to this code frequently to ensure compliance with its principles.
- The Company acknowledges that the code may not address every situation or concern; therefore, associates should consult their supervisor or the Human Capital Head for guidance when needed.

**2. Contents of this Code**  
This Code consists of two sections:  
- **Standards of Conduct**: Guidelines for directors and associates in conducting the company’s business.  
- **Compliance Procedures**: Information on the administration of the code, guidance, reporting and investigating violations, and discussions on waivers and amendments.

**1.1 A Note About Other Obligations**
