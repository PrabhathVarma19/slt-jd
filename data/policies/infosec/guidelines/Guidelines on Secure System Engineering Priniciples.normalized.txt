## 1. Objectives
The objective of this procedure is to provide guidelines on secure system architecture and engineering principles established in the organization.

## 2. Scope
This procedure is applicable to all new and existing systems and application architecture developed at Trianz. It applies to all managed Trianz products and services.

## 3. Security Principles
- Establish a Security Foundation.
- Implement a Risk-Based approach.
- Ensure Ease of Use.
- Increase Flexibility.
- Reduce Vulnerabilities.
- Apply Security by Design.
- Utilize Defense in Depth.
- Ensure Security by Default.
- Design to Fail Securely.
- Never trust inputs from external sources or applications.
- Ensure Secure Deployment.
- Always assume breach and design or implement controls accordingly.
- Follow least privilege or default deny rules.
- Design with usability, manageability, and least functionality in mind.

## 4. Security Foundation
The principles related to Security Foundation include:
- Establish a sound security policy as the foundation, implementing the Information Security Policy.
- Ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical information at all times.
- Protect information assets from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, and disposal.
- Implement security requirements from the initial project initiation.
- Understand and implement security requirements such as:
  - User authentication
  - Secure session controls
  - LDAP authentication
  - Role-based security
  - Rule or role or attribute-based access control with least privilege or default deny policy
  - Track user activities while changing data
  - Encrypt data at the database level
  - Track user activities during read access at the database level (Query band implementation)
- Participate in the evaluation of security products.
- Define physical and logical security boundaries:
  - Implement access control mechanisms for physical access.
  - Provide logical access at the application or product level based on requirements.
- Ensure the project team develops and validates secure applications.
- Define security standards, such as encryption algorithms, as per project requirements.
- Train the team on defined standards.
- Periodically perform Threat Modeling on applications to cover known threats, attack patterns, and vulnerabilities.
- Design and integrate security at all architecture layers (DB, network, application, platform, etc.).
- Implement Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Dynamic Access Management where required.
- Follow secure design principles and conduct security-oriented design reviews.
- Adhere to system hardening procedures and perform Threat and Vulnerability Management (TVM) regularly.
- Design or architect information systems with zero-trust principles in mind.
- Use immutable infrastructure wherever possible.

## 5. Risk Based
- Perform Risk Assessment to ensure risk handling reduces risk to an acceptable level for all projects.
- Based on the risk assessment, implement required controls such as:
  - Encryption
  - Integrity checks
  - Digital signatures
  - Data validation
  - Tokenization
  - Anonymization
  - Pseudonymization
- Implement controls that can detect, prevent, and respond to security events, incidents, and attacks.

## 6. Secure Development
- Adopt "Microsoft Secure Development Guidelines" or an equivalent methodology for Secure Software Development Life Cycle.

## 7. Secure Implementation
- Implement a multilayer access approach to protect assets from unauthorized access or modification.
- Use layered security to protect the application layer and database.

### 8. Ease of Use
- Security measures should be based on open standards to ensure portability and interoperability wherever possible.
- Common language must be used when developing security requirements.
- Security designs should facilitate the regular adoption of new technologies and platforms, including a secure and logical technology upgrade process.

### 9. Reduce Vulnerabilities
- Common errors and vulnerabilities must be identified and prevented, including:
  - Buffer overflows
  - Race conditions
  - Format string errors
  - Failing to check input for validity
  - Programs being given excessive privileges
- Profile or role privileges should be implemented to reduce risk by limiting access to critical system security controls.
- Role-based access controls must be established for various aspects of the system.
- Control must be enforced on who can enable or disable system security features or change user or program privileges.
- Application vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting and SQL injection, can be mitigated by adhering to coding standards, such as using prepared statements in Java, and by utilizing browser plug-ins like Tamper IE during testing.
- SSL certificates must be installed to implement secure transactions.

### 10. Reference(s)
- This policy is based on the implementation guidelines of ISO 27002:2022 and CSA STAR guidelines.

### 11. ISO Control Mapping
- The principles for engineering secure systems must be established, documented, maintained, and applied to any information system development activities, as per ISO 27001:2022 Control 8.27 (Preventive).
