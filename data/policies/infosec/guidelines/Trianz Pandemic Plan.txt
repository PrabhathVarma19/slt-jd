9. Business continuity strategies:
9.1 Work from home model ( Remote Working)
Working from Home model is deployed by assessing and testing the capability
provided to our associates to work from a location apart from the designated Trianz
offices or Trianz client offices (referred to as a ‘remote’ location subsequently), using
Trianz assets and equipment, for a prolonged duration.
Work from home strategy will be activated when the primary/Secondary facilities are
inoperable due to
•

Pandemic/epidemic.

9.1.1 Information technology Assets

is done. Any request for such equipment will need to be authorized by Project
/Delivery manager.

9.1.2 Power and network connectivity

backups. Trianz has provided power backups like UPS to identified critical employees
in the projects/functions.
All associates are equipped with sufficient broadband internet connectivity and
backup internet dongles provided by the company.

9.1.3 Security requirements
•

mandatory security trainings (Information Security, Data privacy etc.) before
availing work from home.

•

All associates must follow and adhere to the remote cybersecurity guidelines
published by the information security team.
