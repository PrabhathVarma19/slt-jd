## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all applications implement adequate security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data at rest, in use, or in motion. This policy defines the security framework and requirements for applications, particularly API and web applications, within Trianz’s production environment.

## 2. Objective
The objective of this policy is to provide guidance and support to project, product, and development teams in delivering secure applications that support Trianz’s business while expediting the security assessment and testing process required to validate new application releases, ensuring they are free of vulnerabilities that could jeopardize the production environment.

## 3. Scope
- All applications that process or store data owned by Trianz are subject to this policy.
- This policy applies to all applications within Trianz’s production environment, including:
  - Externally accessible public-facing applications
  - Internally accessible mission-critical applications
  - Vendor-customizable Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) applications
  - In-house developed applications
  - Cloud-based applications
- The policy is applicable to all Trianz products and services.

## 4. Policy Statements
- Secure development practices must be established, implemented, and documented for all applications developed or purchased, including appropriate security controls to prevent unauthorized access or modification of the system or information.

### 4.1 Application Security Metrics
- Technical and operational metrics shall be implemented according to business objectives and security requirements. Refer to the Trianz Metrics Strategy document.

### 4.2 Data Security
- Data’s confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy must be protected at all times. Proper encryption solutions must be implemented to safeguard data at rest, in use, or in motion.

### 4.3 Access Control
- All access to Trianz’s systems must be authorized and based on individual identification and authentication.
- Application logs must be designed to showcase application user activity audit trails.

### 4.4 Infrastructure Security
- Application hosting solutions must comply with Trianz’s security policies and standards and have a defined Service Level Agreement with the infrastructure provider.
- The infrastructure environment, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and container images must be scanned periodically to identify security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or missing security patches (refer to the Vulnerability Management Policy).
- For cloud or Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions, third-party vendors must provide evidence of periodic security scans, assessments, or audits on their infrastructure environment, and findings must be addressed in a timely manner.

### 4.5 Application Environment
- Infrastructure environments hosting application binaries or source code must have security mechanisms in place to prevent unauthorized access and modification of resources or data.
- Change control procedures must be defined to ensure that only authorized changes, after passing through the required phase gates, approved by the business, and reviewed by Trianz’s Information Security & Data Privacy Assurance team, can be released in a production environment. Deviations in the phase gates require approval from internal and external stakeholders.
- Development and testing activities must not be conducted in the production environment. No production data may be used for troubleshooting in non-production environments.

**4.5 Access Control in Production Environment**  
- Members should not be provided access to the production environment.  
- If specific production access is required for troubleshooting, it must be granted temporarily with the necessary deviation approval.  
- Separation of duties must be implemented to protect the production environment from unauthorized access or modification.  
- A risk assessment shall be performed prior to production for all applications that will store, access, create, and/or transmit confidential or protected information.  

**4.6 Security Assessment and Releases to Production**  
- All modifications of the application must go through a change release process that includes an appropriate security assessment (either automated security scanning or manual testing) to identify potential risks and security impacts to the current production environment.  
- Any application change being deployed in a production environment must comply with Trianz’s security policies, standards, and best practices. Successful completion of the security assessment must be acknowledged by Trianz’s CIO or CISO prior to launch in production.  
- Each release must have a defined roll-back plan in case its migration to the production environment causes service degradation.  

**4.6.1 Security Assessment Level**  
- **Full Assessments**: Test for all known web application vulnerabilities using both automated and manual tools, including manual penetration testing techniques to validate discovered vulnerabilities and assess their overall risk.  
- **Quick Assessments**: At a minimum, consist of an automated scan for the OWASP Top Ten web application security risks.  

**4.6.2 Releases to Production**  
- Releases to a production environment are approved based on the vulnerabilities found during the security assessment.  
- All security issues discovered during assessments or identified by Trianz’s Software Security Assurance Tool must be mitigated based on the following risk levels, which are based on the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).  
- Remediation validation testing is required to validate fixes and/or mitigation strategies for any discovered issues of medium risk level or greater.  

**4.7 Business Continuity**  
- Application business owners must ensure that each application has a defined Business Continuity Plan and a Disaster Recovery Plan to ensure readiness to respond to events that could disrupt the application’s service continuity.  
- Backup and recovery plans and solutions shall be designed according to business requirements.  
- For services provided by third-party vendors, business owners must define the provider’s Service Level Agreement (SLA) with these requirements taken into consideration.  

**4.8 Application End of Life**  
- Decommissioning an application requires the same security precautions as maintaining it in production.  
- Regulatory requirements regarding data retention and destruction must be considered during the decommissioning of an application.  
- If an application cannot maintain compliance with Trianz’s policies and standards, Trianz’s CIO/CISO may provide binding recommendations to mitigate outstanding risks.  

**2. Applicable Standards**  
- ISO 27001:2022-ISMS (Information Security Management System)  
- ISO 27701:2019-PIMS (Privacy Information Management System)  

**3. Reference Policies & Procedures**  
- Information Classification Policy  
- Access Control Policy  
- Business Continuity  
- Change Management Policy  

**4. Exceptions**  
- Exceptions require a documented business justification and are subject to the approval of the CIO/CISO.  
- Requests for exceptions regarding medium and low-risk issues may only be made by an agency’s Information Security Officer (ISO) or the application’s business owner.
