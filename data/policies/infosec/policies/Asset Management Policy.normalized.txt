## 1. Introduction
Asset Management is the process of identifying, classifying, managing, recording, and coordinating the Trianz assets to ensure their security and the continued protection of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. An 'Asset' is defined as any item, system, application, or entity that has potential or actual value to Trianz.

## 2. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to manage organizational assets (tangible and intangible) and document those assets to ensure knowledge and understanding of their value, purpose, risk, and location. 

- All assets are assigned an Information Asset Owner (IAO) responsible for managing, updating, recording, and destroying the asset.
- The nature and value of every asset are documented to restrict access, develop recovery programs, optimize spending, support lifecycle management, and protect customer interests.
- An Information Asset Register (IAR) is utilized to identify, document, and map all information assets, assigning them an owner. Cloud assets are managed by Cloud Administrators.

## 3. Scope
- This policy applies to all assets at Trianz located on premises, offshore, client premises, and cloud infrastructure.
- Client-specific information classification policies shall supersede this policy for specific engagements as per client contractual requirements.

## 4. Objectives
- Ensure individuals with legitimate rights can access information while protecting assets from unauthorized access.
- Help Trianz employees apply correct classification and handling methods in their activities.
- Ensure all assets are handled according to their classification.
- Make Trianz assets available to those with legitimate needs.
- Maintain the integrity of information, ensuring it is accurate, complete, timely, and consistent.
- All employees with access to assets must handle them according to asset classification.
- Asset owners must ensure appropriate use of the Trianz classification scheme.
- Restrict unauthorized addition, removal, update, and management of organizational assets.
