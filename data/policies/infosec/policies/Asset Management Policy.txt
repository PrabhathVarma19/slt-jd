1. Introduction
Asset Management is the process of identifying, classifying, managing, recording,
and coordinating the Trianz assets to ensure their security and the continued
protection of confidentiality, integrity and availability of data. For the purposes of this
policy and associated asset management processes, Trianz defines an 'Asset' as any
item, system, application or entity that has potential or actual value to our
organization.

2. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to manage organizational assets (tangible and
intangible) and to document those assets to ensure knowledge and understanding
of their value, purpose, risk, and location.
Trianz ensures that all assets are assigned an Information Asset Owner (IAO) who
has overall responsibility for managing, updating, recording, and destroying the
asset. The nature and value of every asset is documented and understood for better
enabling the Trianz to restrict access where applicable, develop effective recovery
and continuity programs, optimize spending, support lifecycle management,
strategic decision-making within Trianz and protect the interests and assets
belonging to customers and clients.
Understanding these assets enables us to manage our organization’s information
and systems and the risks associated with them. For this purpose, we utilize an
Information Asset Register (IAR)enabled by a tool to identify, document and map all
information assets, and assign them an owner. In addition cloud assets are
managed and controlled by Cloud Administrators.

into specific engagement for client’s information asset as per client’s contractual

4. Objectives
Asset classification is to ensure that individuals who have a legitimate right to
access a piece of information can do so, whilst also ensuring that assets are
protected from those who have no right to access them.
This policy helps all Trianz employees to ensure that correct classification and
handling methods are applied to their day-to-day activities and managed
accordingly.
This policy is to ensure,

access them.

accurate, complete, timely and consistent with other related information and
events.
