- The standard backup cycle is defined in the Backup and Restoration procedure as daily, weekly, and monthly.

### 5.2 Data Back Up
- IS Operations, delivery teams, and product teams are responsible for providing system support and data backup tasks, ensuring adherence to Trianz’s Disaster Recovery Procedures and Data Retention policies.
- All data must be systematically backed up, including updates required for system re-installation and/or configuration.
- Backup files must be encrypted and appropriately labeled. Systems managing backed-up files should enable storage of dates and codes for easy identification of the original source and type of backup.
- All encryption keys must be securely maintained with clear procedures for prompt decryption of backup media in the event of a disaster.
- If the data contains Personal Data, Personal Sensitive Data, or Personally Identifiable Information, it must be anonymized or erased as per legal and regulatory requirements.
- A recording mechanism must be maintained to document all backup information, including function, data location, date, type of backup (e.g., Incremental, Full), and any failures or issues.
- Copies of backup media must be removed from devices promptly after backup or restore completion.
- Access to the on-site backup location (on-premises or cloud) must be restricted to authorized personnel only.
- Data stored on-premises or in the cloud must be backed up based on defined frequency.
- Backup media must be protected according to the Data Protection and Media Handling Policies.
- Backup data/media no longer required must be clearly marked and recorded for secure disposal, considering environmental factors.

### 5. Data Restoration

- Function Owners must request data restoration by contacting the IS Operations Service Desk or the Project/Product infrastructure management team. It is preferable to raise a service ticket using the IS Service Desk online facility. Only files that the user is authorized to access will be restored.

- The IS Operations Service Desk Team will verify the user's permission and/or authorization to view or obtain restored files or folders. Restored content will be placed back in the same source folder or area, requiring the requestor to have access to that folder/area.

- Function Owners requesting a restore must provide the following information:
  - The reason for the restore.
  - The names of the files and/or folders to be restored.
  - The original location of the files and/or folders; the Service Desk will assist the user in determining this.
  - The date, day, or time of deletion/corruption, or the nearest approximation.
  - The last date, day, or time the user recalls the data being intact and successfully accessed.

- All backup and recovery (restore) procedures must be documented and made available to Data Centre personnel responsible for executing data restores.

- Requests for file or system restores from third-party software/hardware vendors for system support, maintenance, testing, or other unforeseen circumstances must be made under the supervision of the Server Support Team via the IS Operations Service Desk.

- Personnel accessing backup media for restoration must ensure that any media used is returned to a secure location when no longer required.

- A log must be maintained to record the use of backup media whenever it has been requested and/or used from secure storage.

### 5.4 Validation and Testing

- Data archival must be conducted in accordance with the Data Retention policy.

### 5.6 Disposal

- Backup data/media must be disposed of in a secure manner.

### 6. Measurement and Reporting

- The frequency and type of data backup must be measured and reported. The frequency can be daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on criticality and technical feasibility. The type of data backup can be full, differential, or incremental, based on project/function requirements. Data restoration must align with project requirements and technical feasibility.

### 7. Compliance
