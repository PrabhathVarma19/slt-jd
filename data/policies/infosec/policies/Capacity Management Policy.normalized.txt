## 1. Purpose
The use of resources shall be monitored, tuned, and projections made for future capacity requirements to ensure the required system performance. Capacity demands shall be monitored, and projections of future capacity requirements shall be made to enable adequate processing power and storage to be available.

## 2. Objective
The objective of Capacity Management is to understand the business requirements, the organization’s operations, and the IT infrastructure to ensure that all current and future capacity and performance aspects of the business requirements are provided cost-effectively.

## 3. Scope
- This policy applies to all Trianz Associates, Contractors, Vendors, Clients, Cloud Service Providers, Cloud Service Customers, and Products using Trianz IT infrastructure and communication services.
- The requirements of this policy shall be implemented in all systems under the ownership of Trianz, either on-premises or in the cloud, and for all other Trianz managed systems, wherever applicable.
- It is applicable for all Trianz Products and services.

## 4. Policy Statements
- Capacity demands shall be monitored, and projections of future capacity requirements shall be made to enable adequate processing power and storage to be available.
- The IS team shall track information processing needs of various users in coordination with the respective Operations Manager. The Project Manager, along with the IS Team, will estimate critical computer resources required and initiate hardware or software procurement through the finance department.
- System tuning and monitoring shall be applied to ensure and improve the availability and efficiency of systems. Detective and preventive controls shall be implemented to indicate problems in a timely manner.
- Sufficient capacity shall be achieved by increasing capacity or optimizing resource utilization. Examples of managing capacity demand include:
  - Deletion of obsolete data (disk space).
  - Decommissioning of applications, systems, databases, or environments.
  - Optimizing batch processes and schedules.
  - Optimizing application logic or database queries.
  - Denying or restricting bandwidth for non-business critical resource-hungry services (e.g., video streaming).
- For Cloud Services, computing systems shall adapt to workload changes by provisioning and de-provisioning resources automatically (Elastic Scaling) to match current demand. Cost and utilization shall be optimized through Cloud Reservations and periodic reviews of consumption.
- In case of capacity constraints (e.g., processor core applications, storage availability, network bandwidth), changing the subscription or the cloud service provider shall be considered.
