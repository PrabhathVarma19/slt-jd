1. Purpose
The use of resources shall be monitored, tuned and projections made for future
capacity requirements to ensure the required system Performance. Capacity
demands shall be monitored, and projections of future capacity requirements
shall be made to enable adequate processing power and storage is made
available.

2. Objective
The objective of Capacity Management is to understand the business
requirements, the organization’s operations, and the IT infrastructure to ensure
that all the current and future capacity and performance aspects of the
business requirements are provided cost-effectively.

3. Scope
•

This policy applies to all Trianz Associates, Contractors, and Vendors, Clients,
Cloud Service Providers, Cloud Service Customers, Products and who are using
Trianz IT infrastructure and communication services.

•

The requirements of this policy shall be implemented in all the systems under
the ownership of Trianz, either on premises or on cloud and for all other Trianz
managed systems, wherever applicable.

•

It is applicable for all Trianz Products and services.

4. Policy Statements
•

Capacity demands shall be monitored, and projections of future capacity
requirements shall be made to enable adequate processing power and
storage to be made available.

•

IS team shall keep a track of information processing needs of various users
from time to time. This is done in coordination with the respective operations
Manager. As a part of an engagement, project Manager along with IS Team
will estimate the critical computer resources required and hardware or
software procurement. Indent will be raised to the finance department to

ensure and, where necessary, to improve the availability and efficiency of

TRIANZ INTERNAL

systems, Detective & preventive controls shall be put in place to indicate
problems in due time.
•

Sufficient capacity shall be achieved by increasing capacity or by optimizing
resource utilization. Examples of managing capacity demand include:
a) Deletion of obsolete data (disk space);
b) Decommissioning of applications, systems, databases or environments;
c) Optimizing batch processes and schedules;
d) Optimizing application logic or database queries;
e) Denying or restricting bandwidth for resource-hungry services if these are not
business critical (e.g. video streaming).

•

For Cloud Services, computing systems adapt to workload changes by
provisioning and de-provisioning resources in an automatic manner (Elastic
Scaling), such that at each point in time the available resources match the
current demand precisely, it is dynamic adaptation of capacity, by altering the
use of computing resources, to meet varying workload. To optimize cost and
utilization by using Cloud Reservations and periodical review of the
consumption.

•

In case of capacity constraints such as the number of Processor core
applications, the amount of storage available, the network bandwidth
availability – either changing the subscription or changing the cloud service
provider shall be considered.
