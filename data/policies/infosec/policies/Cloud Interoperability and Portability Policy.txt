4.2 Interoperability:
4.2.1 Cloud Interoperability Facets:

Interoperability is not a binary (Yes/No) concept. Interoperability is to be
implemented based on number of elements.

The interoperability facet

model described by ISO/IEC 19941:2017 defines five facets within the context
of cloud interoperability. These five facets are transport, syntactic, semantic
data, behavioral and policy.

Description of each facet including the

requirements and examples are detailed in this section.
Trianz Associates who are implementing or evaluating a Cloud solution
would need to consider detailed facets during execution

TRIANZ INTERNAL

7

4.2.2 Facets of Cloud Interoperability:
Transport interoperability is about common communication infrastructure
established to exchange data between systems. Cloud transport
interoperability is the transfer mechanism between various cloud
computing components, either between CSC components and CSP
components or between CSP components of different cloud services. Few
examples of the Standard Transport Interoperability protocols are REST
based HTTP/S, SOAP, Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and
Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT).
The identified network/transport protocols need to meet industry
accepted cryptographically security standards.

4.2.3 Syntactic Interoperability:
Syntactic interoperability is the ability of two or more cloud systems or
services to understand the structure of exchanged information, which is an
encoding of the domain concepts as defined by the semantic data facet.
Few examples of encoding syntaxes include JSON, XML and ASN.1.( Abstract
Syntax Notation 1) syntaxes

4.2.4 Semantic Data Interoperability:
Semantic data interoperability is the ability for the systems exchanging
information to understand the meaning of the data model within the
context of a subject area.
At the infrastructure level, this concerns virtual machines (VMs),
containers, storage and networking concepts and their management.

TRIANZ INTERNAL

8

At the application level, the domain concepts are dictated by the
application itself, such as Customer Service Management (CSM), Human
Capital Management (HCM), Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
etc.,
At the business domain level, semantic data interoperability concerns the
ability for discrete domain concepts to be shared and understood
between applications. Example approaches include the construction of
ontologies using, for example, OWL, and the use of semantic query
languages like SPARQL

4.2.5 Behavioral Interoperability:
Behavioral interoperability of a cloud service is defined in the service
description. The service description includes a declaration of the interface
provided by the service which is commonly referred to as an API. The API
interface declaration describes the service in terms of a set of operations
provided by the service and the inputs and outputs for each operation.
The behavioral interoperability requires additional information to be
supplied in terms of the expected results of each operation, including
elements such as pre-conditions, post-conditions and any sequences of
operations that are necessary for successful use of the API service.
The behavioral interoperability facet abstracts from implementation
details and describe the behavior of software components in a
representation-independent way.
If the result of an operation against an interface is coherent with the
customer expectations for two different cloud services, the cloud services

TRIANZ INTERNAL

9

are considered interoperable, assuming identical policies have been
applied.
As an example, if the CSC's current order processing system automatically
waits for approval of a submitted order by a listed authority, while a new
system assumes that such an order is already approved, the behavior is
very different and problems will arise, although both process the same
order data otherwise correctly.
CSCs should be enabled to retrieve data programmatically using API like
interfaces based on the business requirements and the business
agreement with the Service Provider.

4.2.6 Policy Interoperability:
Policy interoperability is defined as the ability of two or more systems to
interoperate while complying with the legal, organizational and policy
frameworks applicable to the participating systems.
This facet concerns governmental laws and regulations by regulatory
bodies, CSP and CSC policy terms and conditions and organizational
policies covering the interactions.
Policy interoperability includes regulations or policies which relate to
specific capabilities of the cloud services. One of the principal capabilities
of concern is security.
There can be specific security requirements based on the nature of the
data and the processing involved, for example, where credit card
information is concerned, the cloud service can be required to meet the
requirements of the PCI-DSS standard. There can be more general security
requirements demanded by policies of the CSC, such as a requirement for
TRIANZ INTERNAL

10

the cloud service to be certified against a standard such as ISO/IEC 27001
or ISO/IEC 27017.

4.3 Cloud Data Portability:

4.3.1 Cloud Data Portability Facet Model:

Cloud data portability is the ability to transfer data from one cloud service
to another cloud service or between a CSC’s system to a cloud service using
a machine-readable format.

TRIANZ INTERNAL

12

Like interoperability, data portability can be observed from different facets,
where each facet focuses on a single dimension. To achieve data portability,
all facets need to be understood and mutually agreed upon or sufficiently
understood so that it is clear what facet might need attention when porting
data.
These facets are called data policy, data syntactic and data semantic as
shown in Figure 5. This model is based on the cloud interoperability model in
5.2.1, adapted to focus on the different concerns of cloud data portability.
Trianz Associates who are implementing or evaluating a Cloud solution
would need to consider detailed facets during execution. Also, would need
to ascertain the contracts between the CSC & CSP is clearly stating the
status of the data post termination of the contract which includes
standardized data formats, duration until which CSP will hold that data, data
deletion policy post contract termination etc.,

4.3.2 Data Syntactic Portability:
Data syntactic portability is defined as transferring data from a source
system to a target system using data formats that can be decoded on the
target system, using a particular syntax for encoding the data, such as XML
or encapsulating the data in a packaging format, such as Open
Virtualization Format (OVF) or Zip.

4.3.3 Data Semantic Portability:
Data semantic portability is defined as transferring data to a target such
that the meaning of the data model is understood within the context of a

TRIANZ INTERNAL

13

subject area by the target. A data model (Metadata) expresses the data
items, attributes, logical structures and relationships between data items.
Data models in a cloud context are dictated by the type of cloud service
offering. At the infrastructure level, data models concern VMs, containers,
storage and networking metadata. At the application level, the domain
concepts and data model will be dictated by the application itself viz., CSM,
CRM or ERP.

4.3.4 Data Policy Portability:
Data policy portability is defined as the ability to transfer data between a
source and a target while complying with the legal, organizational and
policy frameworks applicable to the source and target. This includes
regulations on data locality, rights to access, use and share data, and
mutual responsibilities with respect to security and privacy between a CSP
and a CSC.

4.4 Cloud Application Portability:
4.4.1 Cloud Application Portability Facet Model:

Cloud application portability is the ability to migrate an application from
one cloud service to another cloud service or between a CSC’s system to
a cloud service.
The objective is that once ported, the application provides equivalent
functionality in the target environment as it did on the source environment.
TRIANZ INTERNAL

15

The five facets of cloud application portability are application syntactic,
application instruction, application metadata, application behaviour and
application policy.
Trianz Associates who are implementing or evaluating a Cloud solution
would need to consider detailed facets during execution.

4.4.2 Application Syntactic Portability:
Application syntactic portability is migrating an application from a source
system to a target system in a format that can be decoded on the target
system. Application artefacts and metadata are structured according to
a domain model for applications and are encoded using a particular
syntax and packaging format.

4.4.3 Application Instruction Portability:
Application instruction portability is migrating an application from a
source system to a target system so that its instruction set executes on the
target system. Once ported, the software artefacts, orchestration
instructions and other scripts that comprise an application need to be
executed on an infrastructure that appears to the application as similar to
the system for which it was designed. This means ensuring all the
necessary interpreters and execution engines are available.

4.4.4 Application Metadata Portability:
Application metadata portability is migrating an application from a source
system to a target system so that the application metadata is understood
on the target system.

TRIANZ INTERNAL

16

The domain model for an application needs to be mutually understood if
an application is ported from one system to another.
The domain model for an application typically includes metadata about
the application, including what resources the application needs, how it
might be configured, initialization data, etc.

4.4.5 Application behavior Portability:
Application behaviour portability is migrating an application from a source
to a target so that execution on the target produces equivalent results to
those produced on the source.
An application ported from one system to another might not exactly
exhibit the same behaviour in the target system due to the differences in
the execution environment.
This issue might occur if the application is getting ported from legacy to
cloud native environment.

4.2.1 Application Policy Portability:
Application policy portability is defined as migrating an application from
a source system to a target system while complying with the applicable
legal, organizational and policy frameworks of both the source and target
systems.
Examples of policy portability challenges are lack of payment for the cloud
service, lack of a license to run the application in the target system,
regulations preventing running an application in a certain geography, etc.
