## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide directions on Trianz Policies for ensuring security and privacy of information in the Cloud environment in the following scenarios:
- When Trianz acts as a Cloud Service Provider for a client.
- When Trianz consumes cloud-based services as a Cloud Service Customer.
- All policies must be implemented by default as a Cloud Service Provider unless specific client requirements dictate otherwise.
- As a Cloud Service Customer, implementation of all policies must be ensured.

The services offered or consumed can vary from:
- Infrastructure As a Service (IAAS)
- Platform As a Service (PAAS)
- Software As a Service (SAAS)
- Device Managed Services

This policy must be read in conjunction with Trianz Information Security Policy and Data Protection and Privacy Policy as applicable.

## 2. Policy
All policies outlined below apply to all scenarios involving cloud-based environments unless specific client contractual requirements must be met.

### 2.1 Asset Management
- All cloud-related assets must be identified as part of the Asset Inventory, including virtual assets, active and inactive images, and hypervisors (applicable if Cloud Service Provider or Cloud Service Customer/User).
- Records of the inventory must indicate where the assets are maintained, their location, and details of the cloud. These records shall be reviewed periodically (applicable if Cloud Service Provider or Cloud Service Customer/User).
- For all cloud services offered, identify cloud service data and cloud service derived data (shared responsibility of Provider and Customer).
- Project Managers are responsible for cloud asset management (safeguarding the assets) during project execution. Responsibility for client-provided assets shall be as per contractual agreement.
- All cloud assets shall be labeled to ensure identification of resource utilization.
- Asset inventory shall be maintained, and risk management shall be conducted using the EMPMO tool/PM Workbook by respective Project Managers (including subscriptions).

### 2.2 Multi-Tenant Environment and Client Data Isolation
- In multi-tenant environments, segmentation between resources of different clients and between own instances must be assessed in line with Trianz Information Security and Cloud Security Policies.
- A zone approach should be leveraged to isolate instances, containers, applications, and full systems from each other when feasible.
- Implement filtering on incoming and outgoing traffic wherever feasible.
  - Technical controls must limit access for downloading data from the cloud environment to end-user systems, allowing access only for authenticated resources. This can be achieved by deploying terminal servers and allowing authorized users to log in to these servers and connect to cloud systems. This requirement must be analyzed based on client and/or regulatory requirements.
  - For all internal applications and cloud services, Single Sign-On (SSO) shall be enabled.

### 2.3 Encryption
- All confidential data, including personal and sensitive data at rest, must be encrypted.

### 2.4 Identity, Access and Privilege Login Management
- Access to cloud resources must be restricted to necessary exposure to the Internet, and unneeded capabilities/features must be deactivated.
- All cloud computing facets must utilize access control lists (ACL).
- Privileges must be role-based, and privileged access must be audited and recorded.
- If applicable, clients should be enabled with administrative rights to manage or terminate user access.
- Controlled access to log information must be ensured, as it may contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
- Just-in-time access must be provided based on business justification or contractual agreement. Logs must be maintained for at least 3 years for all user access.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be enforced for access to the cloud.

### 2.5 Incident Management
- All cloud security-related incidents must be reported to appropriate stakeholders and to CERT-IN within six hours of any qualified cybersecurity incident, as per the IT Act and contractual agreements.

- Log details must provide a complete trail, identifying login name, date, time, IP address, location, and activities performed.
- Health checks must be performed by the cloud service provider.
- Event logs must record whether any personal data or PII has been changed (added, modified, or deleted) as a result of an event and by whom.
- Criteria must be defined regarding if, when, and how log information can be made available to or used by clients.

### 2.11 Access to Log Records
- Access to log records must be limited to those that relate specifically to a Client's activities, excluding others.
- Controlled (Restricted) access to log information containing Personally Identifiable Information, Personal Data, or Personally Sensitive Data is permitted only for defined purposes.
- All system time must be synchronized with a central NTP server to facilitate event reconciliation and investigations.
- Monitoring must be conducted to detect misuse of the cloud service, such as attacks on others or unauthorized data leaks to Trianz systems.
- All cloud-related log files must be retained for a minimum of three years or as per Client contractual requirements, with automated procedures in place to ensure compliance.
- Refer to the Information Security Logging and Monitoring Policy for further details.

### 2.12 Licensing Requirements
- The cloud service team must identify cloud-specific licensing requirements before allowing any licensed software installation in a cloud service.
- Special attention is required for elastic and scalable cloud services where software may run on more systems or processor cores than permitted by the license terms.

### 2.13 Hardening
- If Trianz acts as a Cloud Service Provider, hardening measures must be implemented to protect the underlying network and infrastructure.
- If Trianz acts as a Cloud Service Customer, it is responsible for protecting actual data, applications, and services, which requires cloud- or service-based security appliances such as firewalls and web gateways, as per contractual agreements.

### 2.14 Password Management
- Shared passwords are strictly prohibited. Passwords must be combined with other authentication systems, such as multifactor authentication, for sensitive areas.
- All cloud instances and services must be discovered and included in the Asset Inventory, and must be managed under password management protocols.
- Shadow IT (unaccounted) cloud resources and passwords must not be allowed to proliferate.

- Govern the impact on compliance, security, and performance of the infrastructure when VM images are created, updated, or patched.
- Maintain consistent change management policies within scalable and automated cloud instance provisioning systems.
- Govern changes to OS credentials when new server images are launched or terminated.
- Monitor and manage changes in OS firewall configurations to identify anomalous or unauthorized changes, ideally integrating internal configuration management solutions with cloud instance-related changes without substantial modifications.
- Recognize that infrastructure change management is an ongoing process due to the rapid and frequent nature of infrastructure changes. All changes should be tracked back to specific user stories to ensure unused instance resources are terminated to avoid unnecessary costs.
- Refer to the System and Software Change Management Policy for more details.
