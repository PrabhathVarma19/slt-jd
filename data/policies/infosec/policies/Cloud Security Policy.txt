2.11 Logging and Monitoring Security Incidents
 Requirement

for logging and monitoring must be documented.

Critical events like deletion, table drop or granting privilege login must
be identified and monitored independently, this can be achieved by
enabling email alerts to cloud service manager and security team.
 The log

details must show complete trail and must identity login

name, data, time, IP address, location and activities performed.
 Health Checks shall be performed by Cloud Service Provider
 Event

logs should record whether or not any Personal Data or

Personally Identifiable Information has been changed (added,
modified or deleted) as a result of an event and by whom.

TRIANZ INTERNAL

10

 Define criteria regarding if, when and how log information can be

made available to or usable by the Clients.
 Where Client is permitted to access log records, ensure access to

records that relate to that specific Client's activities and not of others.
 Ensure

controlled (Restricted) access to log information for only

defined purposes when it contains Personally Identifiable Information
or Personal Data or Personally sensitive Data.
 All system time must be synchronized and point to central NTP server,

wherever feasible. Without such synchronization, it can be difficult to
reconcile events on the cloud service systems with events and aid
during investigations or maintaining the chain for custody.
 Ensure to monitor specified aspects, relevant to the cloud service and

operation of the cloud services. For example, to monitor and detect if
the cloud service is being used as a platform to attack others, or if
sensitive data is being leaked or downloaded from the cloud service
to Trianz system, monitoring identify theft.
 All the Cloud related log files must be retained at least for three years

or based on Client Contractual requirements. Automated procedures
must be available for ensuring this
Refer Information Security Logging and Monitoring Policy for more details.

2.13 Hardening


If Trianz acts as a Cloud Service Provider Hardening shall be to protect
the underlying network and infrastructure



In case of Trianz acting as Cloud Service Customer, Trianz shall be
responsible for protecting the actual data, applications, and services,
which requires cloud- or servicebased security appliances like
firewalls and web gateways. (also the basis of Contractual
agreement)

2.14 Following must be adhered to Password Management
for Privileged and Non-Privileged passwords.



Never allow the use of shared passwords. Combine passwords with
other authentication systems for sensitive areas like multifactor
authentication. Ensure password management best practices.



All Cloud instances and services must be discovered and grouped as
part of this Asset Inventory and needs to be brought under password
management.



Shadow IT (Unaccounted) Cloud resources and passwords should not
arise and proliferate.

standards.

2.15 Virtualization


TRIANZ INTERNAL

Ensure there is proper Lifecycle management of Virtual instances.

12



Ensure Storage and access controls for virtualized instances,
snapshots.



Ensure complete Protection of Hypervisors



Ensure that there are adequate Security Controls governing use of
self-service portals.



Ensure that access to any data previously residing is not visible to
Client when Data storage space is allocated Ensure controls in place
to guarantee that only authorized snapshots are taken, and that these
snapshots' level of classification and storage location and encryption
is

compatible

in

strength

with

the

production

virtualization

environment •


Ensure access to the Hypervisor administrative access logs.

Ensure

Hypervisor Logging is enabled.


Below are examples of Logging that can be ensured:



Use centralized logging: centralize logging of guest OSs, either on a
separate logging system or in a repository. Use of centralized logging
aids administrators, security personnel, and auditors in verifying
configurations and practices in a virtualized environment (e.g.,
ensuring that configurations of guest OSs remain synchronized with
regard to patches, updates and signatures).

o Correlate logs:

correlate server and network logs across virtual and physical
infrastructures to reveal security vulnerabilities and risk.


Regularly audit virtualized environments: it is important to audit
configurations of all components of a virtualized environment,
management capabilities, virtual switches, virtual and physical
firewalls, and other security devices (e.g., intrusion detection systems,
antimalware capabilities).

Ensuring compliance with established

configuration management practices is particularly important.


Root

and

administrative

privileges:

log

monthly

root

and

administrative access and actions on all systems in a virtualized
infrastructure. o Invalid logical access attempts: log weekly all invalid
logical access attempts on all systems in a virtualized infrastructure.

TRIANZ INTERNAL

13



Access to all audit trails: log monthly all access to audit trails on all
systems in and supporting a virtualized infrastructure (e.g., a
centralized log repository).



Initialization of audit logs: log monthly initialization of all audit logs on
all systems in and supporting a virtualized infrastructure (e.g., a
centralized log repository).

o Creation and deployment of Virtual

Machines (VMs): log monthly the creation and deployment of all VMs
in a virtualized environment.

o Migration of VMs: log monthly the

migration (e.g., source and target systems, time, and authorization) of
all VMs in a virtualized environment.


Creation and deletion of system-level objects: log quarterly the
creation and deletion of all system-level objects in a virtualized
infrastructure.

2.16 Information Back up


Ensure additional or alternative mechanisms to off-site backups for
protecting against loss of data (including Personal and Personal and
Sensitive Data or Personally Identifiable information), ensuring
continuity of data processing operations, and providing the ability to
restore data processing operations after a disruptive event.



Multiple copies of data in physically and/or logically diverse locations
(which may be within the information processing system itself) shall
be created or maintained for the purposes of backup and/or recovery
and restored (as per Backup and restoration policy)



Specific requirements from individual jurisdictions if any, regarding the
frequency of backups must be complied with.



If data to be backed up contains Personal data or Personal Sensitive
Data or Personally Identifiable information, it needs to be anonymized
or erased as much as feasible and if there are no specific contractual
Client requirements on the same For more details, please refer to
Backup and Restoration Policy

TRIANZ INTERNAL

2.17 Change Management


Implement and maintain a change management process to track
identified problems, fixes, and releases during the complete service
life cycle for SAAS, PAAS and IAAS based services.



Govern the impact on compliance, security, and performance of the
infrastructure when VM Images are created, updated, or patched.



Maintain consistent change management policies within the scalable
and automated cloud instance provisioning systems.



Govern changes to OS credentials when new server images are
launched or terminated.



Must monitor and manage changes in OS firewall configurations to
identify anomalous or unauthorized changes. Ideally, internal
configuration management solutions can integrate with Cloud
instance

related

changes

without

necessitating

substantial

modifications.


Infrastructure Change management becomes an ongoing process
since infrastructure changes happen rapidly and with high frequency.
As such, all changes should be tracked back to specific user stories.
This approach ensures that the unused instance resources are
terminated and therefore don’t add to the cost when they are not
required or running.

Please refer to the System and Software Change Management Policy for more
details.

2.18 Cloud Service Provider Management


As a Cloud Service Customer, need to ensure the below (as
