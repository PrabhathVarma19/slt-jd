## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that users do not send sensitive or critical information outside the corporate network. Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is the practice of detecting and preventing data breaches, exfiltration, or unwanted destruction of sensitive data.

## 2. Scope
The scope of the policy includes:
1. Network DLP
2. End Point DLP
3. Cloud DLP
4. Storage DLP

## 3. Objective
The objective of this policy is to ensure data protection and incident prevention for Trianz’s business-critical data and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data, which includes sensitive data as per applicable regulations.

## 4. Policy
- Trianz shall adopt a DLP solution that includes data identification and classification to meet complex and evolving compliance standards.
- DLP must be implemented across the following areas:
  - **Network DLP**: Prevent, monitor, and control the flow of information that includes PII data via the company’s network, email, or web.
  - **Endpoint DLP**: Monitor endpoint devices (servers, computers, laptops, and mobile devices) where Trianz’s critical information is used, moved, and stored.
  - **Cloud DLP**: Protect data stored in the cloud by encrypting sensitive data and ensuring it is sent only to authorized cloud applications.
  - **Storage DLP**: Protect data stored in unstructured form on servers or structured data in databases.
- The DLP solution must be fully integrated within Trianz’s cybersecurity architecture.

## 5. Monitoring
The IS operation team shall implement the required solutions and constantly monitor and analyze data to identify potential violations of security policies.

## 6. Compliance
The InfoSec and Data Privacy Assurance Team will verify compliance with this policy through internal and external audits.

## 7. Exception(s)
Exceptions to the Data Loss Prevention policy shall follow the Exception handling policy (e.g., for Finance and HR data with adequate safeguards).
