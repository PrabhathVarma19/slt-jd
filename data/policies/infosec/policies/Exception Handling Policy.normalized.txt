## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this Exception Handling Policy is to establish a structured approach for identifying, reporting, analyzing, and resolving exceptions within the organization. This ensures timely resolution, minimizes security risks, and maintains operational efficiency while complying with legal, regulatory, and organizational requirements.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all published Trianz-defined policies, procedures, and guidelines. It does not apply to any policies or procedures published by groups outside of the Trianz Information Security Management System.

## 3. Policy Statement
An exception to the ISMS/PIMS practices may be granted by the Product/Project Manager, IT Manager, and CISO under the following conditions:
- Implementation of a solution with equivalent protection.
- Implementation of a solution with superior protection.
- Impending retirement of a legacy system.
- Inability to implement the standard due to some limitation.

### Additional Rules:
- Exceptions are granted for a specific period, not exceeding one to three months or the end of the contract, whichever is earlier.
- Exceptions are reviewed on a case-by-case basis; their approval renewal is not automatic.
- The exception review process must log all findings and results in a central repository.
- Approved exceptions must be periodically reviewed semi-annually by Information Systems, InfoSec, Compliance, and the unit requesting the exception.

## 4. Exception Request
All Exception Requests must be logged in the control document under the exception request feature. The process for approval is as follows:
1. Exception ticket creation.
2. IS Help Desk involvement.
3. Reporting Manager Approval.
4. IT Manager Approval (who can decide if further approval is required).
5. If further approval is needed, the request goes to the CISO for final approval or rejection.

### Responsibilities of the Exception Requestor:
- Review and collaborate with the IS team and InfoSec and Compliance team members to:
  - Assess the risks created by the exception.
  - Evaluate potential alternatives.
  - Attain recommendations.

### Required Information in the Exception Request:
- Description of the non-compliance.
- Anticipated length of non-compliance.
- Assessment of risk associated with the requested non-compliance.
- Proposed plan for managing the risk associated with non-compliance.
- Proposed metrics for evaluating the success of risk management.
- Proposed review date to evaluate progress toward compliance.
- Approval of the exception request by the Project Manager/Function Head via email and duly signed in the exception request form.

After InfoSec has reviewed the request and confirmed the details, the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) will review and approve or reject the request.

- If the non-compliance is due to a superior solution, an exception will normally be granted until the published standard or procedure can be revised to include the new solution. An exception request must still be submitted.
