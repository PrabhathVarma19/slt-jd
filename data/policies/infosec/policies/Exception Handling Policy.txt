1. Purpose
The purpose of this Exception Handling Policy is to establish a structured approach for
identifying, reporting, analysing, and resolving exceptions within the organization. This
ensures timely resolution, minimizes security risks, and maintains operational efficiency
while complying with legal, regulatory, and organizational requirements.

2. Scope
This policy applies to all the published Trianz’s defined policy, procedure and guidelines. This
policy does not apply to any of the policies or procedures published by groups outside of
Trianz Information Security Management System.

3. Policy Statement
An exception to the ISMS/PIMS practices may be granted by Product/Project Manager, IT
Manager and CISO, if required for non-compliance resulting from:
•

Implementation of a solution with equivalent protection.

•

Implementation of a solution with superior protection.

•

Impending retirement of a legacy system.

•

Inability to implement the standard due to some limitation

➢ Exceptions are granted for a specific period, not exceeding one month to three months or
the end of the contract, whichever is earlier. Exceptions are reviewed on a case-by-case
basis and their approval renewal is not automatic.
➢ The exception review process must log all findings and results in a central repository

➢ Approved exceptions must be periodically reviewed semi-annually by Information systems,
InfoSec and compliance, and the unit requesting the exception.

4. Exception Request
All Exception Requests should be logged in the control doc under the exception request
feature. All requests will go via service desk team to for the first level reporting Manager
Approval and then IT manager approval.
•

Exception ticket creation > IS Help Desk > Reporting Manager Approval > IT
Manager Approval (Can decide for further Approval required or not) if ‘Yes’ > CISO
for final approval / rejection.

•

An exception requestor should review and work with IS team and InfoSec and compliance
team member to:

▪

Assessment of risk associated with the requested non-compliance

▪

▪

▪

Approval of the exception request by the Project manager/Function head by email and
duly signed in the exception request form.

exception, the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) will review and
approve/reject.

•

•

If the non-compliance is due to a superior solution, an exception will normally be
granted until the published standard or procedure can be revised to include the new
solution. An exception request must still be submitted.
