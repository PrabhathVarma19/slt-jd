## 1. Purpose
This policy establishes requirements for the collection, maintenance, and review of audit logs for Trianz applications and related network resources, in support of identity management and threat monitoring. Audit logs consist of information trails that are used to track and associate user and system activity to events.

## 2. Scope
This policy covers all Trianz assets currently available or that may be created or used in the future. All Trianz employees, contractors, and other stakeholders are responsible for understanding and complying with this policy.

## 3. Policy Statement
- Trianz shall identify systems, applications, or processes that make data vulnerable to unauthorized or inappropriate tampering, uses, or disclosures.
- For each identified system, application, or process, Trianz shall identify user activities (e.g., Create, Read, Update, Delete) that need to be tracked and audited.
- Logging shall include:
  - System, application, and database & file activity whenever available or deemed necessary.
  - Creation, access, modification, and deletion activities.
- Log files shall be regularly examined for access control discrepancies, breaches, and policy violations.
- Data custodians or device managers are responsible for developing appropriate processes for monitoring and analyzing their logs.
- Individuals shall not be assigned to be the sole reviewers of their own user activity.
- System activity review cycles shall include review of audit logs at least every 30 days and may include daily exception reporting.
- The Information Systems team shall be responsible for monitoring and reviewing audit logs to identify and respond to inappropriate or unusual activity.

## 4. Measurement and Review
Audit logging records system and user activities used for system performance tuning, detecting unauthorized access, and investigating incidents.

### 4.1 Log Reporting
Logs must be configured to be of sufficient size to report key events, including:
- Individual access to private data (e.g., file system, application)
- Actions taken by an individual with root or administrative privileges
- Access to audit trails
- Invalid logical access attempts (e.g., authentication failures, ACL issues, missing web pages, web server errors)
- Use of identification and authentication mechanisms
- Initialization of audit logs
- Use of privileges (e.g., sudo, UAC, elevated privileges)
- Activation and deactivation of protection systems (e.g., anti-virus, intrusion detection systems)

Log report key entries must include:
- User identification
- Type of event
- Date and time
- Success and failure indication
- Origination of the event
- Identity or name of affected private data or system
- Network addresses and protocols

Additionally, clocks must be synchronized to the Trianz NTP servers.

### 4.2 Logging Security-Related Events
Security-related events/incidents must be logged in the control dock tool. The Information Security Compliance team will review these events and prescribe corrective measures as needed. Security-related events include, but are not limited to:
- Brute force attempts
- Accounts that have been automatically locked due to failed attempts
- Multiple simultaneous login events from any geo-locations
- Port scan attacks
- Evidence of unauthorized access
- Anomalous occurrences not related to specific applications on the host
- Theft of computing equipment

### 4.3 Log Review and Retention
- Logs and security events for all system components must be reviewed to identify anomalies or suspicious activity.
- The following must be reviewed at least daily:
  - All security events
  - Logs of all system components that store, process, or transmit Cardholder Data (CHD) and/or Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD)
  - Logs of all critical system components
  - Logs of all servers and system components that perform security functions (e.g., firewalls, intrusion-detection systems)

### 5 Compliance and Monitoring

- Review logs from all system components periodically, following the organization’s policies and risk management strategy as determined by the annual risk assessment.
  
- Use automation to enhance the review and analysis of logs. Log reduction, review, and reporting tools must support log analysis without altering original log records.

- Retain all physical and logical access logs, audit trails, etc., for a minimum of five years.

- Implement file-integrity monitoring or change-detection software on logs to ensure existing log data cannot be altered without generating alerts. New data being added should not trigger alerts.

- Write logs for external-facing technologies onto a secure, centralized internal log server or media device.

- Promptly back up audit trail files to a centralized log server or media that is difficult to alter.

- Set proper permissions on log files and utilize a separate server (Central Syslogger) to store all log files.

- Make regular backups of log files and ensure they are encrypted.

### 9 ISO Control Mapping(s)
- **Technological Control**
  - **8.15 Logging Control**: Logs that record activities, exceptions, faults, and other relevant events shall be produced, stored, protected, and analyzed.
  - **8.16 Monitoring activities Control**: Networks, systems, and applications shall be monitored for anomalous behavior, and appropriate actions shall be taken to evaluate potential information security incidents.

- **Organizational Controls**
  - **5.28 Collection of evidence**: The organization shall establish and implement procedures for the identification, collection, acquisition, and preservation of evidence related to information security events.
