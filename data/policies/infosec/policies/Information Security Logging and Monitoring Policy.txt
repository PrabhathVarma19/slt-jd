1. Purpose
This policy establishes requirements for the collection, maintenance and review of
audit logs for Trianz applications and related network resources, in support of
identity management and threat monitoring. Audit logs consist of information trails
that are used to track and associate user and system activity to events.

2. Scope
This policy covers all Trianz assets which is available currently, or which may be
created, used in the future. All Trianz employees, contractors and other
stakeholders are responsible for understanding and complying with this policy.

3. Policy Statement
Trianz shall identify the systems, applications, or processes that make data vulnerable
to unauthorized or inappropriate tampering, uses or disclosures. For each identified
system, application, or process. Trianz shall identify user activities (e.g. Create, Read,
Update, and Delete) that needs to be tracked and audited.
Logging shall include system, application, and database & file activity whenever
available or deemed necessary.

•

Logging shall include creation, access, modification and deletion activities.
Log files shall be regularly examined for access control discrepancies,
breaches, and policy violations.
Data custodians or device managers are responsible for developing
appropriate processes for monitoring and analyzing their logs.
Individuals shall not be assigned to be the sole reviewers of their own user
activity.
System activity review cycles shall include review of audit logs minimally every
30 days and may include daily exception reporting.
The Information Systems team shall be responsible for monitoring and
reviewing audit logs to identify and respond to inappropriate or unusual
activity.

4 Measurement and Review
Audit logging records system and user activities used for system performance
tuning, detecting unauthorized access and to investigate incidents.

4.1 Log Reporting
Configure logs to be of sufficient size to reporting key events such as:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Individual access to private data (e.g., file system, application)
Actions taken by an individual with root or administrative privileges
Access to audit trails
Invalid logical access attempts (e.g., authentication, ACL, missing web
page, web server error)
Use of identification and authentication mechanism
Initialization of audit logs
Use of privileges (e.g., sudo, UAC, elevated use of privileges)
Activation and de-activation of protection systems, such as anti-virus
and intrusion detection systems
Configure log report key entries to include:
➢
➢
➢
➢
➢
➢
➢

•

user identification
type of event
date and time
success and failure indication
origination of the event
identity or name of affected private data, or system
network addresses and protocols

Synchronize the clock to the Trianz NTP servers.

4.2 Logging Security-Related Events
Security-related events/incidents must be logged in the control dock tool.
Also, the Information Security Compliance team will review these events and
prescribe corrective measures as needed.
Security-related events include, but are not limited to:
•

Brute force attempts

TRIANZ INTERNAL

•

Accounts that have been automatically locked due to failed attempts

•

Multiple simultaneous login events from any geo-locations

•

Port scan attacks

•

Evidence of unauthorized access

•

Anomalous occurrences that are not related to specific applications on

the host
•

Theft of computing equipment

4.3 Log Review and Retention
•

Review logs and security events for all system components to identify
anomalies or suspicious activity.

•

Review the following at least daily:
•

All security events

•

Logs of all system components that store, process, or transmit CHD
and/or SAD

•

Logs of all critical system components

•

Logs of all servers and system components that perform security
functions

(for

example,

firewalls,

intrusion-detection

systems/intrusion-prevention systems (IDS/IPS), authentication
servers, e-commerce redirection servers, etc.)
•

Review logs from all other system components periodically based on the
organization’s policies and risk management strategy, as determined by
the organization’s annual risk assessment.

•

Automation can improve the review and analysis of logs. However, log
reduction, review, and reporting tools should support log analysis without
altering original log records

•

All physical and logical access logs, audit trails etc. shall be retained for a
minimum of five years.

TRIANZ INTERNAL

5 Compliance and Monitoring
•

Use file-integrity monitoring or change-detection software on logs to ensure
that existing log data cannot be changed without generating alerts (although
new data being added should not cause an alert)

•

Write logs for external-facing technologies onto a secure, centralized, internal
log server or media device

•

Promptly back up audit trail files to a centralized log server or media that is
difficult to alter

•

Set proper permissions on log files and use a separate server (Central
Syslogger) to store all log files

•

Make regular backups of the log files and encrypt log files.
