## 1. Introduction
This Information Security Policy promotes an effective balance between information security practices and business needs. The Policy helps Trianz Inc. (hereinafter “Trianz”) meet our legal obligations and our clients' expectations. Trianz may implement different levels of security controls for different information assets based on risk and other considerations.

## 2. Purpose
Trianz handles sensitive information of clients. Protection of client information is vital to Trianz. To fulfill this strategic objective, Trianz has implemented an information security management system.

## 3. Objectives
Top Management will provide commitment and direction to establish and maintain information security:
- Ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical information at all times.
- Protect information assets.
- Protect critical information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, and disposal, whether intentional or unintentional.
- Ensure identification of the Information Security Objectives.
- Commit to continually improve the Information Security Management System based on Information Security Objectives.

## 4. Trianz Information Security Policy Statement
Trianz is committed to implementing processes and systems to protect and safeguard the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of all critical information and information processing assets from internal and external threats to ensure secure business operations. All associates are expected to read, understand, and follow this Policy. However, no single policy can cover all possible information security issues the organization may face. Associates must seek guidance from their manager or other designated Trianz resources before taking any actions that create information security risks or deviate from this Policy's requirements.

**4.1 Guiding Principles**  
Trianz follows these guiding principles when developing and implementing information security controls:  
- Trianz strives to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information assets and those of its clients.  
- Trianz will comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws.  
- Trianz will balance the need for business efficiency with the need to protect sensitive, proprietary, or other confidential information from undue risk.  
- Trianz will grant access to sensitive, proprietary, or other confidential information only to those with a need to know and at the least level of privilege necessary to perform their assigned functions.  
- Recognizing that an astute workforce is the best line of defense, Trianz will provide security training opportunities and expert resources to help individuals understand and meet their information security obligations.  
- Trianz will define Information Security Objectives against Information Security Controls for better control effectiveness and continual improvement.  

**4.2 Scope**  
- This Policy applies across the entire Trianz enterprise, including external vendors, service providers, clients, and business partners that may have access to Trianz’s organizational information.  
- Employees must follow this Policy in addition to any obligations listed in the applicable code of conduct or employee handbook.  
- Individuals are personally responsible for taking or avoiding specific actions as stated in the Policy. In some situations, the Infosec & Data Privacy Assurance Team, or another Trianz resource, will take or avoid the stated actions.  
- Trianz may approve and make available more detailed or location or business unit-specific policies, procedures, standards, and processes to address specific information security issues. Compliance with these additional documents is required unless an approved exception is obtained.  

**4.3 Resources**  
- No single document can cover all possible information security issues. Balancing the need to protect Trianz's information assets with work requirements can be challenging.  
- Many effective organizational, people, physical, and technical controls are available. Do not assume the cost or time required to implement them; seek help if needed.  
- You must seek guidance before taking any actions that create information security risks. Contact your manager for assistance.

- To enforce compliance with Trianz's policies and protect its interests, Trianz reserves the right to monitor any and all use of its network and systems as permitted by applicable law.  
- By using Trianz's systems, you agree to such monitoring, which may include intercepting and reviewing network traffic, emails, or other messages or data sent or received, and inspecting data stored on individual file directories, hard disks, or other printed or electronic media.  

**4.5 Regulatory Compliance**  
- Various information security and data protection or privacy laws, regulations, and industry standards apply to Trianz and the data handled, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Personal Data, or Personal Sensitive Data.
