## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that employees can be productive and functional while away from the office by providing them with laptop computers that enable access to necessary computing resources.

## 2. Objective
This policy establishes a systematic framework for the distribution of laptops to all Trianz employees. Employees are accountable for the security of company-provided laptops, regardless of where they are used.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all Trianz employees, including Contractors and Interns.

## 4. Entitlement
- All Trianz associates will be allocated a laptop.
- Associates who are Grade 10 and above will receive a sleeker version of the laptop that suits their business needs.

## 5. General Terms of Use

- Laptops and any enabled input/output devices are for business use only; unauthorized software installation or non-approved transfers are prohibited.
- The Trianz IS team may install monitoring/tracking mechanisms on laptops and does not guarantee data privacy.
- Employees must adhere to the following security guidelines:
  - Do not allow unauthorized persons (e.g., friends/relatives) to access the laptop.
  - Do not use removable media (e.g., flash drives) without permission from the Trianz IS team and ensure they are scanned with Antivirus. USB ports are blocked as a security measure, with exceptions requiring prior approval.
  - Employees will be charged for lost or physically damaged laptops.
  - In case of a lost laptop, an FIR copy and an incident report must be submitted.
  - HR, IS Operations, and Infosec must be informed about any loss or damage.
  - The recovery amount for lost or damaged laptops will be communicated to associates and sent to benefits@trianz.com by IS Operations; HR will coordinate with Finance for recovery.
  - Keep the laptop in your possession and within sight, especially in public places (e.g., airports, railway stations, restaurants).
  - The IS team has the right to conduct inspections of allocated laptops without prior notice. Employees must submit laptops for random audits if required.
  - Employees must not take laptops for repair to any external agency or vendor.
  - Associates are responsible for storing personal data in the organization-provided OneDrive and should note the make, model, serial number, and Trianz asset label of their laptop, but not keep this information with the laptop.

## 6. Returning of Laptop/Company Assets during Employees Exit
- The HR team will send an email at least a week before an employee's exit, and the exit process in the e-separation tool will be initiated for employees, contractors, and interns.
- The return of the laptop will be initiated during the exit process.
- The laptop can be returned through the following means:
  - Direct return by the employee at the office: The employee must return the laptop directly to the IS team with prior notification to HR, especially in cases of direct walk-in after the exit date.
  - Collection enabled by the Admin department.

### 7. Laptop/Other Assets Allocation on Transfers from One Country to Other Countries

- Upon notification from the HR function regarding an employee's transfer from one country to another (e.g., India to USA), laptop allocation will be initiated.
- The employee must return the laptop to the IS team at the base location (e.g., India) before departing for the new country.
- Employees are required to raise a ticket with necessary approvals from their reporting manager to facilitate the return of the laptop at the base location and the issuance of a laptop in the new country.
- The employee must complete the “Laptop/Other assets handover checklist” available in the Blue Book and submit it to the IS team for processing.
- Prior to returning the laptop, the employee must store all scoped data in the Company’s OneDrive.
- Upon arrival at the new base location (destination country), the local IS team will issue a new laptop to the employee, contingent on approval from the reporting manager.
- The laptop handover process will adhere to the scenarios outlined in Section 6.

### 8. Exceptions

- Desktops, monitors, and other accessories will be provided based on business needs.
- For any exceptions or deviations, employees must obtain CIO approval through their project or department head. Following approval, a request can be submitted to the Trianz IS Team.
