## 5. Patching Schedule

### IT Infrastructure
- **Monthly**: Apply critical security patches, security updates, general system updates, and critical third-party application patches and upgrades based on security recommendations.
- **Quarterly**: Perform server updates.
- **On-demand**: Deploy high/critical severity patches immediately based on security recommendations.

### Printers, Peripherals, Switches, Routers, Firewalls, and Storage

#### 5.1.1.2 Zero-day Vulnerabilities
- **Immediate Risk Assessment**: Identify affected systems, assess impact, and determine exposure.
- **Emergency Patch Deployment**: Apply vendor-released patches or hotfixes as soon as they become available.
- **Temporary Mitigations**: If no patch is available, implement workarounds such as disabling affected services, applying firewall rules, or restricting access.
- **Expedited Testing**: Conduct rapid testing of patches in a controlled environment before deployment to prevent system disruptions.
- **Prioritized Deployment**: Apply patches on critical systems first, followed by non-critical assets.
- **Monitoring & Threat Intelligence**: Continuously monitor for new threats, indicators of compromise, and vendor updates.
- **Incident Response Integration**: Align with the incident response process to contain, eradicate, and recover from potential exploitation.
- **Post-Patch Review**: Validate successful updating of patches, conduct security testing, and update documentation for future reference.
