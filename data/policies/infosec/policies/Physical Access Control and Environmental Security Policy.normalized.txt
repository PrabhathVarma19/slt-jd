## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to define the requirements for protecting Trianz information and technology resources from physical and environmental threats and to reduce the risk of loss, theft, damage, or unauthorized access to those resources or interference with Trianz operations.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all parties operating within Trianz’s network environment or utilizing Information Resources. It covers:
- Data networks, LAN servers, and personal computers (stand-alone or network-enabled) located at Trianz offices and company production-related locations.
- Any personal computers, laptops, mobile devices, and servers authorized to access Trianz’s data networks.
- No employee is exempt from this policy.

## 3. Policy

### 3.1 Physical Security Perimeter
The physical layout of Trianz’s information processing facilities will be segregated into perimeter zones with varying levels of access restrictions:
- **Public Zone and Reception Zone**: Limited restrictions; area under overall surveillance.
- **Office Zone**: Limited access; registration with reception required; area under overall surveillance.
- **Restricted Access Zone**: Limited access; access logged; escorted access for visitors; area under surveillance (e.g., secure bays).
- **Highly Restricted Access Zone**: Specifically authorized personnel only; highly restricted access; logged access; specific authorization required for employee and visitor access; area under surveillance (e.g., server room).

### 3.2 Physical Entry Access
- All employees, contractors, consultants, and visitors must carry Trianz approved identification badges.
- Physical access to Trianz information systems facilities is restricted to authorized persons only, granted only for business or technical reasons.
- Logs of access must be retained for a minimum of three years.
- Secure areas (restricted zones) must be protected with a combination of access control devices (e.g., physical barriers, intrusion alarms) and access-logging equipment (e.g., card key systems, security cameras).
- Access to sensitive or critical information processing facilities outside normal working hours must be specifically authorized and logged.
- Employees must declare their belongings (e.g., laptops, mobile phones) before entering restricted premises, and security must verify these declarations.

### 3.3 Visitor Management System
Visitors must have supervised and controlled access to secure areas, which includes:
- Signing a Visitors Log that is retained and reviewed. The log must record the visitor’s name, company, purpose for visiting, time of entrance, time of departure, and date.
- Wearing a visitor badge to indicate a non-associate is present. Visitors must produce picture identification to obtain the badge. Those without badges should be challenged for identification.
- Being escorted by Trianz personnel or an individual with a current Trianz company badge while in the building.
- Declaring their belongings (e.g., laptops, mobile phones) before entering restricted premises, with security verifying these declarations.

### 3.4 CCTV
- Surveillance cameras shall be installed and monitored in areas perceived as high risk, unless otherwise required.

### 3.5 Securing Offices, Telecommunications Closets, Data Center and Facilities
- Data centers, equipment rooms, and telecommunications closets must be protected from unauthorized or unnecessary access.
- All data centers, equipment rooms, and telecommunications closets must be locked when unattended.
- Network devices (routers, switches, hubs) must be placed in restricted access zones to prevent unauthorized access.
- All source media for operating system software, applications, backup tapes/devices, and license keys must be clearly labeled and stored in a restricted access software library, accessible only to authorized personnel.
- Adequate intrusion detection controls (e.g., burglar alarms, motion detectors) and safety devices (e.g., fire alarms, smoke detectors, closed-circuit televisions) must be installed in all office locations, switch rooms, and data centers.
- Data centers must be protected by appropriate air conditioning and very early smoke detection systems.
- Support functions and equipment (e.g., photocopiers, fax machines) should be protected from unauthorized access.
- No combustible or hazardous materials are allowed in restricted zones.

### 3.6 Power Supplies
- Equipment must be protected from power failures and electrical anomalies.
- Electrical supply must conform to the manufacturer’s specifications for each piece of equipment.
- Critical equipment must be supported by an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), and backup power generating equipment should be in place where possible.
- Power supply backup equipment (including UPSs and backup generators) must undergo regular maintenance and testing.

### 3.7 Equipment Maintenance
- Equipment must be maintained according to manufacturers' recommendations to ensure availability and integrity.
- All faults (or suspected faults) must be logged in the current Incident Management System.
- All changes must be logged in the current Change Management System.

### 3.8 Wireless Access Points
- Wireless access points should be installed at a high level to reduce exposure to theft or tampering.

### 3.9 Clear Desk and Clear Screen Policy
- Clear desk and clear screen guidelines must be implemented at each Trianz office location, including:
  - Paper and computer media must be stored in suitable locked cabinets or security furniture when not in use, especially outside working hours.
  - Sensitive or critical business information should be locked away (ideally in a fire-resistant safe or cabinet) when not required, especially when the office is vacated.
  - Personal computers, terminals, and printers must not be left logged on when unattended and should be protected by password-protected screen savers with a minimum 15-minute time delay.
  - Sensitive or classified information must be cleared from printers immediately after printing.

### 3.10 Protection Against Environmental Factors

### 4. Monitoring and Reporting
- Reporting metrics and documentation templates are described in the approved and published Trianz Physical and Environmental Security Procedure. These reports shall be used to evaluate the effectiveness of physical and environmental security controls and must be made available to Information Security and Internal Audit upon request.

### 5. Compliance
- Implementation and enforcement of this policy is the responsibility of the IT Operations and Admin Team. The Information Security and Internal Audit Team will conduct periodic audits to ensure compliance with the policy and procedure without notice.

### 6. Exception(s)
- Exceptions to this policy require formal written approval from the Information Security Assurance Team.
