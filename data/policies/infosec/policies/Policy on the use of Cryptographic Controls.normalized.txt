## 1. Purpose
- The purpose of the cryptographic controls policy is to:
  - Ensure confidential information is received, transmitted, and stored in an encrypted form.
  - Ensure compliance with statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements.
  - Allow authorized employees access to relevant information held in encrypted form when needed.

## 2. Scope
- This policy applies to all Trianz employees, contractors, Cloud Service Providers, Cloud Service Customers, and other stakeholders responsible for understanding and complying with this policy.
- The requirements of this policy shall be implemented in all systems owned by Trianz, whether on-premises or in the cloud, and for all other Trianz-managed systems, wherever applicable.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities
1. **Cryptographic Controls - Cloud Service Provider**
   - Provide information on the cryptography used to process Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to the Cloud Service Customer.
   - Assist the Cloud Service Customer in applying its cryptographic controls.

2. **Cryptographic Controls - IS Team/Cloud Service Customer**
   - Ensure that cryptographic controls are justified by risk analysis.
   - Verify that:
     - Controls meet the cryptography policy.
     - Controls are compatible with other cryptographic protections.
     - Controls apply to data at rest, in transit, and in use within the Cloud Service.
     - Certification Authority (CA) details are issued.

## 4. Policy
- The confidentiality of information imported or transferred on portable media or across networks will be protected using appropriate techniques such as:
  - Encryption
  - Data masking
  - Pseudonymization
  - Anonymization

- **Encryption Usage:**
  - Encryption will be used on all remote access connections to Trianz’s network and resources.

- **Protection for Data in Transit:**
  - Encryption controls must be used when transferring confidential data over an external network to protect sensitive information.

- **Remote Access to the Trianz Network:**
  - Systems providing access to the Trianz network from the Internet must implement robust authentication methods, including passwords and encryption, to control access to information or systems.
  - The design and installation of such systems, like the Trianz Virtual Private Network (VPN), must be authorized by IT to prevent unauthorized access to Trianz information assets.

- **Data Storage / Data at Rest:**
  - Data stored or archived must be protected based on its classification. Ideally, data should be encrypted, but other access controls may suffice depending on sensitivity.

- **Data in Processing:**
  - Data must be protected using encryption while being processed, as applicable.

- **Key Management:**
  - Considerations for implementing data masking techniques include:
    - Not granting all users access to all data.
    - Using obfuscated data in certain cases.
    - Complying with any legal or regulatory requirements.

  - Considerations for using data masking, pseudonymization, or anonymization include:
    - Strength of data masking based on the usage of processed data.
    - Access controls to processed data.
    - Agreements or restrictions on the usage of processed data.
    - Prohibiting the collation of processed data with other information to identify the PII principal.
    - Keeping track of providing and receiving processed data.

- **Encryption Key Management:**
  - All encryption keys must be securely stored, with access strictly restricted as defined by the access control policy.
  - All encryption keys must be changed periodically based on their usage requirements.
  - Trianz may use RSA secure ID tokens based on two-factor authentication for accessing client applications, as required by the client.

### 6. User Responsibilities
- Users are personally responsible for the secure use and protection of their private key.
- The IS team shall act as the custodian of the RSA tokens.
- Trianz shall adhere to best practices for encryption.

### 5. Reference
- Guidelines for Information Labeling and Handling
- ISO 27001:2022

### 6. Exception(s)
- There are currently no exceptions. Any exceptions to the Cryptographic Controls policy shall follow the Exception Handling policy.

### 7. ISO Control Mapping(s)
- **Category of Control:** Technological Controls
- **ISO 27001:2022 Control:** 8.24 Use of Cryptography
- **Document Name as per ISO 27001:2022:** Policy on the use of cryptography, including cryptographic key management, shall be defined and implemented.
