- Performing risk assessments across all corporate functions.
- Carrying out risk assessments on an ongoing basis.
- Involving the following steps in risk assessment:
  - Risk Identification
  - Risk Analysis
  - Evaluation of Risk
  - Risk Monitoring
- Maintaining a continuously updated Risk Log.
- Categorizing risks into the following types:
  - Business
  - Client
  - Operational
  - Regulatory & Standards
  - Delivery
- Ensuring compliance with ISO 9001:2015, ISO 20000-1:2018 standards, and striving to adhere to ISO 31000 - Risk Management guidelines.
- Gathering inputs for risk identification from stakeholders, project/business unit operational issues, non-conformities/observations from audits, resource management issues, schedule and effort deviations, and quality issues.
- Identifying opportunities to be explored from uncertainties and monitoring them as appropriate.

### 3. Definitions/Abbreviations/Acronyms
- The organization shall implement policies and procedures to identify risks across projects, corporate functions, and business functions.
- The organization shall adopt risk management procedures, including:
  - Risk Assessment
  - Risk Analysis and Evaluation
  - Risk Treatment
- Risk Management steps include:
  - **Risk Identification:**
    - Project Managers (PM) identify risks from the Proposal/Contract Phase to Deployment/UAT.
    - Risk identification is an ongoing activity for business and corporate functions.
  - **Risk Analysis, Evaluation, and Treatment:**
    - Each identified risk shall be analyzed for acceptability in the project.
    - Risk magnitude is calculated based on impact and probability.
    - Risks may be:
      - Avoided: Completely eliminating the probability of occurrence.
      - Transferred: Shifting negative impact to a third party.
      - Mitigated: Proactively changing plans to minimize the probability of occurrence (residual risk remains).
    - Residual risks must be verified for acceptable levels of risk magnitude (≤ 9).
    - For risks with a magnitude ≥ 27, considered high, mitigation plans shall be implemented.
    - Contingency plans shall be applied for risks that have already occurred.
  - **Risk Monitoring:**
    - Risks shall be monitored monthly during SMRs (Status Management Reviews).
    - Verification of mitigation and contingency plans shall occur during DA (Design Approval) reviews and SMR reviews.
    - New additional risks shall also be verified and mitigated as necessary.
