## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish a process to define security requirements for the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for all projects and products across Trianz.

## 2. Objective
The objective of the Secure SDLC Policy is to:
- Facilitate efficient implementation of security controls throughout the Development Life Cycle for Trianz managed applications.

## 3. Scope
The successful implementation of the Secure SDLC Policy requires a consistent and systematic approach to Secure SDLC across Trianz’s projects and products. The scope of the policy is as follows:
- Secure SDLC shall be applicable to all Implementation, Support, and Testing projects under the applicable Cloud, Analytics, Digitization, Infrastructure Practices, and Trianz products and services.
- This policy applies to all existing and new software developed by Trianz Delivery Teams for internal, external, or Client Managed Systems.

## 4. Policy Statements
- Information Security & Data Privacy will be applicable at all stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (i.e., Requirements, Design, Coding, Validation, Release and Response, Maintenance, and Decommission).
- This policy aims to be language and platform independent, applicable across all software.
- During all phases of the SDLC where a system is not in production, the following conditions must be met:
  - The system must not have live data sets that contain information identifying actual people or corporate entities.
  - The system must not contain actual financial data such as account numbers, security codes, or routing information.
  - Sensitive information must never be used outside of production environments.
- Ensure Security Metrics applicability for performance improvement at each stage.

### 4.1 Requirement Phase:
- Ensure conformance with all appropriate security, privacy, and compliance requirements using techniques such as Security Risk Analysis, Threat Modeling, and Use Cases/Abuse Cases.
- Adhere strictly to the CIA triad and authentication, authorization, and accountability policies.
- All development community members must undergo Secure SDLC training (Online or Classroom).
- Applications handling, processing, or storing critical, personal, or sensitive data must follow applicable Data Privacy Guidelines.
- Use organization-specific expectations and approved principles for secure coding for both in-house and outsourced code developments.

### 4.2 Design Phase:
- Conduct Threat Modeling to identify potential vulnerabilities, high-risk interfaces, and countermeasures.
- Plan to meet security and privacy requirements and goals.
- Design Test Scenarios based on Cases/Abuse Cases.
- Protect sensitive information throughout its life cycle.
- Include Security Architecture Design Principles by following Guidelines on Secure System Engineering Principles (e.g., web, applications, user interfaces, programmatic interfaces, file import/export, reports, and databases).
- Limit access to source code and other critical system resources during development, testing, or production to authorized personnel as per Access Control Policy.
- Conduct periodic Secure Architecture Reviews as per Design Principles by following Guidelines on Secure System Engineering Principles.

### 4.3 Development Phase:
- Follow Secure Coding guidelines during coding.
- Conduct Security Code Reviews for every code check-in/build.
- Code reviews can be either manual or automated using technologies such as Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Software Composition Analysis (SCA).

### 4.4 Validation Phase:
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), Static Application Security Testing (SAST), and Software Composition Analysis (SCA) shall be conducted for monitoring third-party libraries.
- Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Testing, along with Compliance Checks, shall be performed during the Validation Phase.
- Backend network security controls, including DMZ, Network Firewall, Web Application Firewall (WAF), and Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), must be implemented and reviewed.
- Security findings must be remediated, ensuring no open critical, high, or medium vulnerabilities in SAST, DAST, and Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT).
- Backup and restore mechanisms must be in place as part of Business Continuity Planning (BCP) and Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP).
- Testing shall occur during and after development, with SAST processes identifying security vulnerabilities in software.

### 4.5 Release and Response:
- Secure deployment practices and separation of duties must be followed.
- Application code must be reviewed and approved by the Project/Product/Application Architect prior to deployment.

### 4.6 Maintenance Phase:
- Change management must be included in the maintenance phase.
- A Risk Assessment must be performed when the system is modified.
- All significant changes in application code must be reviewed for vulnerabilities prior to deployment.
- Regular maintenance and updates of software are required to address changes in technology, integrations, and emerging vulnerabilities.
- Code reviews must be conducted whenever the code is modified or changed.
- Periodic vulnerability assessments must be performed on production/Application Support systems, with appropriate measures taken to address identified vulnerabilities.
- Source code must be protected against unauthorized access and tampering, utilizing configuration management tools for access control and version control.

### 4.7 Decommission Phase:
- Data must be securely removed when the system is retired, in accordance with the Data Retention Policy.

### 5. Roles and Responsibilities:
- **Internal Apps Team**: Conduct necessary scans and provide reports.
- **Project Manager**: Define the strategy for appropriate security standards for all internal software applications handling sensitive information, monitor, establish, and enforce remediation timelines and sanctions for non-compliant systems.
- **IS Operations**: Perform vulnerability scans on applications and provide reports.
- **InfoSec Team**: Manage the end-to-end application security assessment, review and follow-up to remediate the Vulnerability Assessment scan and Code Review report, and track the closure report.
- **CIO/CISO**: Review and approve the final assurance report.
