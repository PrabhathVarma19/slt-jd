1. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish a process to define security requirements
for Software Development Life Cycle for all the projects, products across Trianz.

2. Objective
The objective of Secure SDLC Policy is to: •

Facilitate efficient implementation of security controls throughout the Development
Life Cycle for Trianz managed applications.

3. Scope
The successful implementation of the Secure SDLC Policy requires a consistent and
systematic approach to Secure SDLC across Trianz’s projects and Products. Scope
of the policy is as follows.
•

Secure SDLC shall be applicable to all Implementation, Support and Testing projects
falling under the applicable Cloud, Analytics, Digitization, Infrastructure Practices
and Trianz products and services
This policy applies to all existing and new software developed by Trianz Delivery
Teams for internal, external or Client Managed Systems.

4. Policy Statements
Information Security & Data Privacy will be applicable at all stages of the Software
Development Life Cycle (i.e., Requirements, Design, Coding, Validation, Release and
Response, Maintenance and Decommission)
TRIANZ INTERNAL

This policy aims to be language and platform independent so that it is
applicable across all software
During all phases of the SDLC where a system is not in production and following
conditions are met i.e., the system must not have
a) live data sets that contain information identifying actual people or corporate
entities,
b) actual financial data such as account numbers, security codes, routing information,
c) or any other financially identifying data. Information that would be considered
sensitive must never be used outside of production environments.
Ensure Security Metrics applicability for improvement of performance at each stage
For each phase of the Development Life Cycle, Trianz Secure SDLC Policy shall
ensure the following

4.1
•

Requirement Phase:
Ensure conformance with all appropriate security, privacy and compliance
requirements by using the Techniques – Security Risk Analysis, Threat Modeling, Use
cases/ Abuse Cases

•

Ensure CIA triad and authentication, authorization and accountability policies are
strictly adhered

•

Ensure all development community shall undergo Secure SDLC training (Online or
Classroom)

•

All applications handling, processing or storing critical or Personal or sensitive data
shall follow applicable Data Privacy Guidelines.

TRIANZ INTERNAL

•

Organization-specific expectations and approved principles for secure coding shall
be used for both in-house and outsourced code developments.

4.2 Design Phase:
•

Threat Modeling shall carry out to identify potential vulnerabilities, the high-risk
interfaces, and any countermeasures

•

Ensure planning to meet security and privacy requirements and goals.

•

Test Scenarios shall be designed based on Cases/Abuse Cases

•

Sensitive information shall be protected throughout its life cycle.

•

Shall include Security architecture Design Principles by following Guidelines on
Secure System Engineering Principles (e.g., web, applications, user interfaces,
programmatic Interfaces, file import/export, reports, and databases).

•

Access to source code and other critical system resources during development,
testing or production shall be limited to authorized personnel as per Access Control
Policy.

•

Periodic Secure Architecture Review shall be conducted as per Design Principles by
following Guidelines on Secure System Engineering Principles

4.3 Development Phase:
•

Secure Coding guidelines shall be followed during the coding

•

Security Code Reviews shall be carried out in every code check-in/built.

•

Code reviews can be either manual or automated using technologies such
as static application security testing (SAST) and Software Composition Analysis
(SCA) tools for open-source components.

TRIANZ INTERNAL

•

Defensive Programming Techniques are applied for coding (wherever
applicable)Controls and remediation against the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities,
CWE/SANS Top 25 Programming errors shall be applicable as per Technologies

•

Secure coding practices specific to the programming languages and techniques
shall be used.

4.4 Validation Phase:
•

DAST, SAST, SCA for monitoring third party libraries, Penetration Testing and
Vulnerability Testing and Compliance Check shall be carried out during the
Validation Phase

•

Ensure the backend Network security controls such as DMZ, Network firewall, WAF,
IDS/IPS are implemented and reviewed.

•

Security findings shall be remediated and managed such as No open critical, High,
medium vulnerabilities open in SAST, DAST and VAPT,

•

As part of BCP, DRP-All backup and restore mechanisms are in place.

•

Testing shall be conducted during and after development. Static application
security testing (SAST) processes shall identify security vulnerabilities in software

4.5 Release and Response
•

secure deployment and separation of duties shall be practiced.

•

Application code for applications shall be reviewed and approved by the
Project/Product/Application Architect prior to deployment.

4.6 Maintenance Phase:
•

Shall include Change management

TRIANZ INTERNAL

7

•

Perform Risk Assessment when the system is modified.

•

Ensure all significant changes in application code shall also be reviewed for
vulnerabilities prior to deployment.

•

The software’s shall require regular maintenance and updating, to keep up with
changes to common technology, integrations with new tools, and emerging
vulnerabilities.

•

Code reviews shall be conducted whenever the code is modified/changed

•

Periodic vulnerability assessments shall be performed on production /Application
Support systems and appropriate measures taken to address the risk associated
with identified vulnerabilities.

•

Source code shall be protected against unauthorized access and tampering (e.g.
by using configuration management tools, which typically provide features such as
access control and version control).

4.7 Decommission Phase:
•

The data shall be removed securely when the system is retired as per the Data
retention policy
