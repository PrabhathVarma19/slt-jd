The purpose of this policy is to provide security and compliance responsibilities shared between the Service Provider and the Customer when hosted in the Cloud along with the supply chain partner’s management.

## 2. Objectives
The objective of the Shared Security Responsibility Model Policy is to facilitate effective implementation of the security and controls for the different cloud service models.

## 3. Scope
This policy document covers the Shared Security Responsibility Model in the Cloud where Trianz acts as a Cloud Service Customer (CSC) or Cloud Service Provider (CSP) for the different Managed Cloud Service Models.

## 4. Policy Statement

### 4.1 Cloud Shared Responsibilities – Provider vs Customer:
- **On-Prem**: The Customer is responsible for all aspects of the On-prem infrastructure.
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: The Provider supplies infrastructure (servers and networking devices/services), while the Customer is responsible for installing software, provisioning virtual servers, containers, and controlling configurations.
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: The Provider offers a computing platform and technical stack, allowing the Customer to focus on building and managing applications (e.g., AWS Lambda).
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: The Provider delivers the entire infrastructure and application, with the Customer only needing to log in and use the application.
- **Identity**: Defines the user through identifiers such as user ID or employee number.
- **Authentication**: Verifies the user's identity based on credentials.
- **Authorization**: Determines user access rights.
- **Accountability**: Ensures actions performed by the user are traceable for accountability.
- **Customer Content**: Includes data, text, images, audio, video, customer-developed software, configured machine images, and customer code. Provider-managed account information is not classified as Customer Content.

### 4.2 Responsibility:

#### 4.2.1 Security & Compliance Accountability:
- The Customer is ultimately accountable for security and compliance, regardless of the Cloud Service Model.
- The Customer must ensure that all shared security responsibilities throughout the supply chain, including those of the service provider, are documented, implemented, and managed.
- The Customer is responsible for the security and compliance of the platform.

#### 4.2.2 Data Classification & Management:
- The Customer must securely identify, label, and classify data to meet compliance obligations across all Cloud Service Models.
- Providers must provide written contracts detailing how customer data security and privacy will be managed in the Cloud.
- The Provider’s commitments should include security and privacy practices, limitations on customer data use, and adherence to regulatory compliance, along with evidence of certifications and audit reports available to the customer.
- The Customer should periodically verify that the cloud provider meets these controls and consider switching providers if data protection needs are not addressed.
- In the IaaS Service Model, the Provider's capabilities are limited to enabling the Customer’s virtual environment to accommodate data classification capabilities. The Customer is responsible for configuration.

### 4.2.2 Data Protection Responsibilities
- **PaaS Service Model**: 
  - The Provider's capabilities are limited to enabling the Customer's virtual environment and application to accommodate the required data classification capabilities.
  - The Provider is responsible for authentication, while the Customer must configure and handle authorization for user data access.
  
- **SaaS Service Model**: 
  - The Provider must enable data protection, user authentication, and user authorization.
  - The Customer is responsible for configuring data authorization for users based on defined roles.

### 4.2.3 Client & End-point Protection
- The Provider is responsible for enabling end-point protection for cloud services across all service models.
- The Customer must ensure the security of devices connecting to cloud services.
- The Customer must ensure that all cloud-connecting endpoint devices are:
  - Hardened
  - Patched
  - Encrypted
  - Secured with mobile management solutions that provide remote wipe services in case of theft.
- The Provider must facilitate mobile management capabilities for the Customer's endpoint devices, which must be configured by the Customer in the SaaS Model.

### 4.2.4 Identity & Access Management
- Identity & Access Management (IAM) enables the implementation of IAAA principles: Identity, Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability on the cloud platform.
  
- **IaaS Service Model**: 
  - The Provider delivers IAM capabilities, while the Customer must configure and manage IAM controls.
  
- **PaaS & SaaS Service Models**: 
  - IAM controls are a shared responsibility between the Customer and Provider.
  - The following must be considered and implemented for an effective solution:
    - Identity provider
    - Identity services configuration
    - User roles
    - User identities configuration
    - Access control configuration
  
- The Customer must assess additional security considerations before implementation, including:
  - Just in Time (JIT) administrative access
  - Multi-Factor Authentication
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) capabilities (own or third-party applications)

### 4.2.5 Application-Level Controls
- Application-level controls are necessary to secure the application layer from security breaches.
  
- **IaaS Service Model**: 
  - The Customer is responsible for protecting the application layer deployed on Virtual Machines/Containers from attacks, breaches, or compromises.
  - The Customer must deploy skilled administrators to manage and secure the application and underlying hosts.
  
- **PaaS Service Model**: 
  - Application controls are a shared responsibility between the Customer and Provider.
  - The Provider delivers application controls with default configurations, which the Customer must configure to meet security and business needs.
  
- **SaaS Service Model**: 
  - The Provider is responsible for application layer security controls and compliance.
  - The Customer can use audit reports from the Provider to evidence application layer controls.

### 4.2.6 Network Control
- Network control secures and configures inter/intra connectivity of the platform.
- The network elements to be secured include, but are not limited to:
  - Virtual Machines
  - Containers
  - Pods
  - Virtual networks
  - Perimeter devices
  - Gateways
  - Proxies
  - Load balancers
  - DNS solutions
  
- **IaaS Service Model**: 
  - The Provider is responsible for network security of the underlying infrastructure across regions and availability zones.
  - The Customer is responsible for network security of devices and services deployed in the infrastructure instances they manage.
  
- **PaaS & SaaS Service Models**: 
  - Network security control is abstracted from the Customer and provided as part of the service by the Provider, who holds responsibility for network security control.

### 4.2.7 Host Infrastructure
- Host infrastructure security controls include protecting, managing, and securing compute, storage, and platform services.
- Key controls for host infrastructure include:
  - OS configuration
