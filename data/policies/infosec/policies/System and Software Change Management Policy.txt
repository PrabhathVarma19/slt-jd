1. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish management direction and high-level
objectives for change management and also to ensure controlling the changes to the
organization, business processes, information processing facilities and systems that
affect information security.
Various controls are categorized to mitigate the risk as follows:
• Information being corrupted and/or destroyed;
• Computer performance being disrupted and/or degraded;
• Productivity losses being incurred; and
• Exposure to reputational risk
• Any changes that are being done in cloud service are not affecting the cloud
services.

2. Scope
This policy applies to all parties operating within the Trianz’s network environment
or utilizing Information Resources, Cloud service provisioning and Cloud service
consumption. It covers the data networks, LAN servers and personal computers
(stand- alone or network-enabled), located at Trianz offices and company
production related locations, where these systems are under the jurisdiction
and/or ownership of Trianz including cloud environment, and any personal
computers, laptops, mobile device and or servers authorized to access the Trianz’s
data networks and Cloud Networks. None of the employees is exempted from this
policy.

3. Policy
Changes to information resources shall be managed and executed according to a
formal change control process. The control process shall ensure that the changes
proposed are reviewed, authorized, tested, implemented, and released in a
controlled manner; and that the status of each proposed change is monitored.

5. Operational Requirements
5.1 Change Documentation
All change requests shall be logged whether approved or rejected on a
standardized and central system. The approval of all change requests
and the results thereof shall be documented. A documented audit trail,
maintained at a Business Unit Level, containing relevant information shall
be maintained at all times. This should include change request
documentation, change authorization and the outcome of the change.
No single person should be able to effect changes to production
information systems without the approval of other authorized personnel.
All the change items shall be included in either MSA or SLA.

5.2 Change Classification
All change requests shall be prioritized in terms of benefits, urgency,
effort required and potential impact on operations.

5.3 Change Testing
Changes shall be tested in an isolated, controlled, and representative
environment (where such an environment is feasible) prior to
implementation to minimize the effect on the relevant business process,
to assess its impact on operations and security and to verify that only
intended and approved changes were made.

5.4 Changes affecting SLA’s
The impact of change on existing SLA’s shall be considered. Where
applicable, changes to the SLA shall be controlled through a formal
change process which includes contractual amendments.

5.5 Approval
All changes shall be approved prior to implementation. Approval of
changes shall be based on formal acceptance criteria i.e. the change
request was done by an authorized user, the impact assessment was
performed and proposed changes were tested. All major changes shall
be informed to information security and data privacy assurance team
and seek approvals if necessary.

5.6 Communicating changes
All users, significantly affected by a change, shall be notified of the
change. The user representative shall sign-off on the change. Users
shall be required to make submissions and comment prior to the
acceptance of the change.

5.7 Change Implementation
Implementation shall only be undertaken after appropriate testing
and approval by stakeholders. All major changes shall be treated as
new system implementation and shall be established as a project.
Major changes will be classified according to effort required to
develop and implement said changes.

5.8 Roll-Back Procedure
Procedures for aborting and recovering from unsuccessful changes
shall be documented. Should the outcome of a change be different to
the expected result (as identified in the testing of the change),
procedures and responsibilities shall be noted for the recovery and
continuity of the affected areas. (Added for clarification)

5.9 Emergency Changes
Specific procedures to ensure the proper control, authorization, and
documentation of emergency changes shall be in place. Specific
parameters will be defined as a standard for classifying changes as
Emergency changes.

5.10 Verification of Changes
All changes shall be verified during and after implementation. On
unsuccessful implementation, fall back procedures will be in place to
ensure systems can revert back to what they were prior to
implementation of changes, as the case may be.

5.11 Communication of Changes
All changes are communicated to all stakeholders that information
security requirements have been met.

6. Monitoring
Reporting metrics, documentation templates and change implementation
reports are described in the approved and published Trianz Change
Management Procedure. Change implementation reports should be
generated and maintained by the IT team, which will be used to summarize
the outcome of the changes implemented. These reports shall be made
available to Information Security and Internal Audit upon request.

7. Compliance
Any person, subject to this policy, who fails to comply with the provisions as
set out above or any amendment thereto, shall be subjected to
appropriate disciplinary or legal action in accordance with the Trianz
Disciplinary Code and Procedures. Company Information Security policies,
standards, procedures and guidelines shall comply with legal, regulatory
and statutory requirements.
All changes shall adhere to the policy to ensure the reliability of the systems
and applications.

8. Exceptions(s)
Exceptions to the System and Software change management policy shall follow the
Exception handling policy.
