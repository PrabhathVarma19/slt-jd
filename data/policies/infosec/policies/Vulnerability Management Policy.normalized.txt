## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all information assets connected to the Trianz network infrastructure, including but not limited to:
- Computer workstations
- Laptops
- Tablets
- Smartphones
- Servers
- Appliances
- Network switches
- Routers

The Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) are responsible for ensuring vulnerability assessments on any information asset, product, or service within Trianz.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities
1. **CISO/CIO**
   - Responsible for overseeing vulnerability assessments.
   
2. **Vulnerability Assessment Operations (IS)**
   - Apply all applicable fixes, patches, and updates in a timely manner.
   - Routinely review vendor sites, bulletins, and notifications.
   - Implement vulnerability mitigation strategies in accordance with the organizational vulnerability management program.
   - Track likely vulnerabilities and available patches for their assets.
   - Conduct vulnerability assessments as per the schedule.
   - Review vulnerability assessment reports for management reporting.

## 4. Policy Statement
Processes must be documented to identify, classify, and remediate vulnerabilities across all technology environments and platforms to reduce Trianz’s exposure to cyber threats. The following actions are required:

- Establish a vulnerability and patch management process to:
  - Ensure information systems are patched in a timely manner.
  - Maintain a patch management process consistent with patch provider recommendations.
  - Reduce service disruptions, incidents, and problems caused by vulnerabilities.
  - Provide a defined, repeatable method for consistent execution of patch management activities.
  - Clarify stakeholder/participant roles and responsibilities.
  - Capture key performance metrics for performance monitoring and improvement.
  - Define roles and responsibilities associated with vulnerability management.

- Perform asset discovery scans on the internal network and update asset inventories as necessary, in support of the Asset Management policy.

- Monitor security-related email alerts and vendor notification sites for vulnerabilities affecting systems or applications.

- Conduct credentialed vulnerability scans, including endpoints (desktops and laptops) where technically feasible.

- Perform automated vulnerability scans at least quarterly on internal and external networks.

- For PCI-specific environments:
  - Conduct vulnerability scans on externally facing IP addresses using an Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) and track findings through remediation.
  - Perform ad hoc vulnerability assessments after significant changes to the PCI environment (e.g., new system component installations, changes in network topology, firewall rule modifications, major version upgrades).
  - Conduct vulnerability scanning before significant infrastructure or application upgrades or modifications are implemented into production.

- Perform manual vulnerability assessments periodically to identify difficult-to-detect vulnerabilities.

- Test for unauthorized wireless access points on Commonwealth networks quarterly.

- Review public-facing web applications using manual or automated application vulnerability security assessment tools or methods at least quarterly.

### 1. Vulnerability Management

1.1 **Change Management and Web Application Firewall**
- Applications must be assessed after any change to the PCI environment.
- A web application firewall must be installed in front of public-facing web applications as a mitigating control.

1.2 **Penetration Testing**
- Conduct internal and third-party network-layer and application-layer penetration testing at least annually.
- Alternatively, collect evidence to confirm that a third party has performed a vulnerability assessment.

1.3 **Vulnerability Review and Reporting**
- Timely reviews of vulnerability information from internal and external sources must be performed and reported to the Trianz Chief Assurance Office. The report must include:
  - Vulnerability description
  - Hosts affected
  - Current status at the time of reporting
  - Recommendations for remediation
  - Supporting information

1.4 **Vulnerability Prioritization**
- Vulnerabilities must be prioritized using a risk-based approach based on severity levels:
  - **Critical**: Threat actor may gain control of the host or leak confidential information. Remediation timeframe: 1 day.
  - **High**: Threat actor may access sensitive information stored on the host, including security settings. Remediation timeframe: 3 days.
  - **Medium**: Threat actor may collect sensitive information from the host, such as software version. Remediation timeframe: 7 days.
  - **Low**: Limited risk to the host. Remediation timeframe: 14 days.

1.5 **Mitigation and Remediation**
- Necessary actions must be taken to minimize the likelihood and impact of threats exploiting vulnerabilities by implementing security controls within established timeframes.
- Vulnerabilities must be remediated by deploying patches or making configuration changes, with appropriate testing conducted prior to patch deployment.
- If a patch or mitigation strategy is unavailable, a mitigating control must be enacted, or approval for a security deviation from the CIO/CISO is required.

1.6 **Reporting and Metrics**
- Report through various stages of the vulnerability and patch management process using established performance metrics. Summary reports must inform management of the current status and effectiveness of the vulnerability and patch management program.
- IS Operations must report vulnerabilities monthly to the CIO/CISO Office, including:
  - Vulnerabilities by severity and aging
  - Vulnerabilities with deviations in place
  - Open and closed vulnerabilities

1.7 **Periodic Vulnerability Assessments**
- Conduct periodic vulnerability assessments of information assets, network equipment, and applications, fixing all gaps found during the assessment.
- A quarterly vulnerability assessment must be conducted enterprise-wide or as per client requirements, repeating until "clean results" are obtained.
- Any major change in the IT environment must be followed by a vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.

1.8 **Penetration Testing Requirements**
- Penetration tests must be carried out by either a third-party organization specialized in security testing or by specialized internal resources. The tests must:
  - Cover the entire Trianz network perimeter and critical systems.
  - Include testing from both inside and outside the network.
  - Validate any segmentation and scope-reduction controls.
  - Review and consider threats and vulnerabilities experienced in the last 12 months.
  - Specify retention of penetration testing results and remediation activities results.

1.9 **Wireless Network Scans**
- Wireless network scans must be performed using a Wireless Analyzer on a quarterly basis.

1.10 **System File Integrity Monitoring**
- System file integrity monitoring must be conducted on all critical servers in the production environment and servers storing cardholder information.

1.11 **Function Owner Responsibilities**
- All function owners must adhere to the timeline requirements for reacting to notifications of relevant vulnerabilities.

### 5. Measurement and Review

5.1 **Remediation Metrics**
- Measure the mean time interval taken to remediate/patch vulnerabilities after identification by the Vulnerability Assessment (VA) tool.

5.2 **Asset Scanning Ratio**
- Measure the ratio of known assets (from the Asset Management solution) to those actually scanned, split by internal and external assets.

5.3 **Risk-Based Prioritization**
- Use risk-based prioritization of vulnerabilities, considering factors such as CVSS, asset criticality, exploit availability, asset accessibility (Internet vs. Intranet), and asset owner.

5.4 **Average Risk Exposure**
- Calculate the average risk exposure based on the risk-based prioritization of vulnerabilities.

5.5 **Patch Status**
- Measure the percentage of systems that are fully patched.

### 6. Compliance and Monitoring

- **User Access Rights**: Conduct a periodic review of the entire user identity, provisioning, and access rights lifecycle. Findings, analysis, and recommendations must be reported to senior management within the established timeline.

- **Configuration Standards**: Perform a periodic review of critical system resources to ensure applicable hardening. Findings must be reported to senior management within the established timeline.

- **Network Architecture and Topology**: Conduct a periodic review of the entire Resolver security architecture to ensure a layered, Defense in Depth approach is utilized. Findings, analysis, and recommendations must be reported to senior management within Resolver.

### 7. Exception(s)
- None
