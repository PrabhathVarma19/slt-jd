1. Purpose
This policy shall ensure managing risks related to technical vulnerabilities in an
effective, systematic, and repeatable way, and to confirm the effectiveness of
actions.

2. Scope
This policy applies to all information assets connected to the Trianz network
infrastructure including but not limited to computer workstations, laptops, tablets,
smartphones, servers, appliances, network switches and routers, etc. The Chief

4. Policy Statement
Processes to identify, classify and remediate vulnerabilities across all technology
environments and platforms to reduce the Trianz’s exposure to cyber threats must
be documented.

Establish a vulnerability and patch management process to:

•

Ensure information systems are patched in a timely manner.

•

Ensure that the patch management process and cadence is consistent with the
recommendation of patch providers.

•

Reduce the number of service disruptions, incidents and problems caused by
vulnerabilities.

•

Provide a defined, repeatable method for ensuring consistent execution of
associated patch management activities and tasks.

•

Provide clarity around stakeholder/participant roles and responsibilities.

•

Enable key performance metrics to be captured for performance monitoring
and improvement.

•

Define roles and responsibilities associated with vulnerability management.

•

In support and consistent with the Asset Management policy, perform asset
discovery scans on the internal network; update asset inventories as
necessary.

•

Monitor security-related email alerts and/or vendor notification sites for
vulnerabilities that may affect systems or applications.

•

Perform credentialed vulnerability scans. Where technically feasible, include
endpoints (i.e., desktops and laptops).

•

Conduct automated vulnerability scans, at a minimum quarterly, on internal
and external networks.

•

For PCI-specific environments, perform vulnerability scans on externally facing
IP addresses; use an Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) and track findings
through remediation.

•

Perform ad hoc vulnerability assessments after any significant change to the
PCI environment (e.g., new system component installations, changes in network
topology, firewall rule modification, major version upgrade).

•

Perform vulnerability scanning before any significant infrastructure or
application upgrade or modification (e.g., new system component installations,
changes in network topology, firewall rule modifications) is implemented into
production.

•

Perform manual vulnerability assessments on a periodic basis to identify
difficult to detect vulnerabilities.

•

Test

•

Review public-facing web applications via manual or automated application
vulnerability security assessment tools or methods at least quarterly.

•

For PCI specific environments, perform reviews on public-facing web
applications after any change to the PCI environment, or install a web
application firewall in front of a public-facing web application as a mitigating
control.

•

Conduct internal and third-party network-layer and application-layer
penetration testing at least annually or collect evidence to attest that the third
party has had a vulnerability assessment performed.

•

Perform timely reviews of vulnerability information received from internal and
external sources (e.g., software suppliers) and report to the Trianz Chief
Assurance Office. The report shall include:

❖ Vulnerability description
❖ Hosts affected
❖ Current status at the time of reporting
❖ Recommendations for remediation
❖ Supporting information

Vulnerabilities shall be prioritized using a risk-based approach

•

Limited risk to host.

Perform necessary actions to ensure that the likelihood and impact of threats,
which can potentially exploit vulnerabilities are minimized by implementing
security controls within the established timeframes.

•

Remediate vulnerabilities by deploying patches or making configuration
changes as a mitigation strategy. Appropriate testing must be conducted prior
to patch deployment.

•

In the event that a patch or mitigation strategy is not available to remediate the
vulnerability, a mitigating control shall be enacted or an approval for security
deviation from the CIO / CISO is required.

•

Report through the various stages of the vulnerability and patch management
process using established performance metrics. Summary reports shall be
used to inform management of the current status and effectiveness of the
vulnerability and patch management program.

•

IS Operations must report vulnerabilities on a monthly basis to the CIO/CISO
Office:
❖ Vulnerabilities by severity and aging
❖ Vulnerabilities with deviations in place
❖ Open and closed vulnerabilities

•

On a quarterly basis Vulnerability assessment to be conducted enterprises wise
or as per Client requirements. Assessments are repeated until “clean results”
are obtained.

•

Any major change in the IT environment has to be followed by vulnerability
assessment and penetration testing to the setup. These penetration tests
conducted on Annual basis.

Application Layer and Network Layer Penetration

Tests (including components that support network functions as well as
operating systems)

•

The Penetration tests must be carried out either by Third party organization
specialized in Security Testing or by specialized internal resource. It shall be
ensured that penetration test.

❖

Includes coverage for the entire Trianz Network perimeter and critical
systems

❖ Includes testing from both inside and outside the network
❖ Includes testing to validate any segmentation and scope-reduction

controls
❖ Includes review and consideration of threats and vulnerabilities

experienced in the last 12 months
❖ Specifies retention of penetration testing results and remediation

activities results.

•

Wireless Network scans are performed using Wireless Analyzer on quarterly
basis.

•

System File Integrity Monitoring must be done on all critical servers in
production environment and servers storing Cardholder information.

•

All function owners to follow the timeline requirements for reacting to
notifications of relevant vulnerabilities.

5. Measurement and Review
•

Mean time interval taken to remediate / patch vulnerabilities after identification
by the Vulnerability Assessment (VA) tool. (i.e. post detection)

•

This measures the ratio of known assets (e.g.: from Asset Management solution)
to those which actually get scanned and an be split by Internal Assets & External
assets.

•

Based on Risk based Prioritization of vulnerability, considering a number of
factors (e.g.: CVSS, Asset Criticality, Exploit Availability, Asset Accessibility
(Internet vs Intranet), Asset Owner etc.)

•

Based on Risk based Prioritization of vulnerabilities (outlined above), the
average risk exposure can be calculated based on different groupings.

•

What % of systems are fully patched and have no high severity vulnerability
present and can be reported by asset groups.

•

Inputs for above measurements are obtained from Vulnerability assessment
tool and for more details; you can refer to Vulnerability Assessment and
Penetration Testing (VAPT) procedure

6. Compliance and Monitoring
•

Users Access right: Periodic review of the entire user identity, provisioning and
access rights lifecycle, with findings, analysis, and recommendations reported
to senior management within timeline.

TRIANZ INTERNAL

•

Configuration Standards: Periodic review of critical system resources for
ensuring the applicable hardening reported to senior management within
timeline.

•

Network Architecture and Topology: Periodic review of the entire Resolver
security architecture for ensure a layered, Défense in Depth approach is being
utilized, with findings, analysis, and recommendations reported to senior
management within Resolver.
