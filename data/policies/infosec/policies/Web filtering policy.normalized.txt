## 1. Introduction
Web filtering enables Trianz to monitor, manage, and regulate users' web activity. By allowing access to approved websites (green sites) and blocking malicious or noncompliant content, web filtering helps protect against cybersecurity threats, enforce corporate policies, and enhance overall network security. This ensures a secure and productive browsing environment while mitigating risks such as malware, phishing, and unauthorized data access.

## 2. Objectives
- Establish controls to ensure authorized network traffic and prevent unauthorized access to the Internet.
- Enhance Cybersecurity by preventing access to malicious websites that may contain malware, phishing attempts, or other cybersecurity threats.
- Ensure Compliance by enforcing regulatory, legal, and organizational policies through restricted access to unauthorized or non-compliant web content.
- Mitigate Insider Threats by monitoring and controlling employee web activity to identify and prevent potential security risks from within the organization.

## 3. Purpose
- Protect systems from malware compromise and prevent access to unauthorized web resources.
- Eliminate security risks such as malware infection that may arise from access to external websites with malicious content.

## 4. Policy
Trianz shall establish and implement necessary controls to prevent employees from accessing external websites that may contain viruses, phishing materials, or other types of illegal information. The Infosec and IS Team shall determine which websites shall not be accessed by employees, and the IS team shall implement these restrictions in the security controls.

### a) Web Filtering Practices
- **URL Categorization:**
  - Blacklists and Whitelists are compared against predefined lists of known malicious or safe websites.
  - Human reviewers assess URLs and assign them to appropriate categories based on their content.
  - Contextual Analysis of URLs is categorized based on the context in which they are shared or accessed.

- **Web Content Filtering:**
  - Maintain log details of each access attempt, including the user, time, URL, and action taken (allowed or blocked). These logs can be used for auditing, compliance, and troubleshooting purposes. Reporting features provide insights into web usage patterns and policy violations.

- **SSL Inspection:**
  - Decrypt and inspect encrypted HTTPS traffic to enforce content filtering policies on secure connections.
