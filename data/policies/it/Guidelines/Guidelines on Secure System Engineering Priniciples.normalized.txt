## 1. Objectives
The objective of this procedure is to provide guidelines on secure system architecture and engineering principles established in the organization.

## 2. Scope
This procedure is applicable to:
- All new and existing systems and application architecture developed at Trianz.
- All managed Trianz products and services.

## 3. Security Principles
The following security principles are established:
- Security Foundation
- Risk Based
- Ease of Use
- Increase Flexibility
- Reduce Vulnerabilities
- Security by design
- Defense in depth
- Security by default
- Fail Securely
- Never trust inputs from external sources or applications
- Secure deployment
- Always assume breach; design or implement controls accordingly
- Always follow least privilege or default deny rules
- Always design with usability, manageability, and least functionality in mind

## 4. Security Foundation
The principles related to the Security Foundation are as follows:
- Establish a sound security policy as the foundation, defined and implemented through the Information Security Policy.
- Identify security objectives, including:
  - Ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical information at all times.
  - Protecting information assets.
  - Safeguarding critical information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, and disposal, whether intentional or unintentional.
- Implement security requirements from the initial level of project initiation, including:
  - User authentication
  - Secure session controls
  - LDAP authentication
  - Role-based security
  - Rule, role, or attribute-based access control with least privilege or default deny policy
  - Tracking user activities while changing data
  - Encrypting data at the database level to prevent unauthorized access
  - Tracking user activities during read access at the database level (Query band implementation)
- Participate in the evaluation of security products.
- Define physical and logical security boundaries:
  - Implement access control mechanisms for physical access.
  - Provide logical access at the application or product level based on requirements.
- Ensure the project team develops and validates secure applications.
- Define security standards, such as encryption algorithms, according to project requirements.
- Train the team on the defined standards.
- Periodically perform Threat Modeling on applications to cover all known threats, attack patterns, and vulnerabilities as per the Threat Modeling procedure.
- Design and integrate security at all architecture layers (DB, network, application, platform, etc.).
- Implement Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Dynamic Access Management wherever required.
- Always follow secure design principles and conduct security-oriented design reviews.
- Follow system hardening procedures and perform Threat and Vulnerability Management (TVM) regularly.

### 5. Risk Based
- Perform a Risk Assessment to ensure risk handling reduces risks to an acceptable level for all projects.
- Based on the risk assessment, implement the following required controls:
  - Encryption
  - Integrity checks
  - Digital signatures
  - Data validation
  - Tokenization
  - Anonymization
  - Pseudonymization
- Implement controls that can detect, prevent, and respond to security events, incidents, and attacks.

### 6. Secure Development
- Secure Development must adopt "Microsoft Secure Development guidelines" or an equivalent methodology of Secure Software Development Life Cycle.

### 7. Secure Implementation
- Implement a multilayer access approach to protect assets from unauthorized access or modification.
- By implementing layered security, the project team will protect:
  - Application layer (e.g., LDAP authentication, credentials)
  - Database layer
  - Integration layer
  - Data
- Technical review compliance will be verified by Delivery Assurance at checkpoints and toll gates.

### 8. Ease of Use
- Where possible, base security on open standards for portability and interoperability.
- Use common language in developing security requirements.
- Design security to allow for regular adoption of new technology and platforms, including a secure and logical technology upgrade process.

### 9. Reduce Vulnerabilities
- Identify and prevent common errors and vulnerabilities, such as:
  - Buffer overflows
  - Race conditions
  - Format string errors
  - Failing to check input for validity
  - Programs being given excessive privileges.
- Implement profile or role privileges to reduce risk by limiting access to critical system security controls.
- Implement role-based access controls for various aspects.
- Control who is allowed to enable or disable system security features or change user or program privileges.
- Reduce application vulnerabilities (e.g., cross-site scripting, SQL injection) by following coding standards, such as using prepared statements in Java, and identifying issues during testing with browser plug-ins like Tamper IE.
- Implement SSL for secure transactions by installing SSL certificates.

### 10. Reference(s)
- Implementation guidelines from ISO 27002:2022 and CSA STAR guidelines.

### 11. ISO Control Mapping
- **Category of Control**: 8.27 Principles for engineering secure systems
