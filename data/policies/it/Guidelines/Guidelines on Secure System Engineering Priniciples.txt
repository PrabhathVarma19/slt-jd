1. Objectives
    The objective of this procedure is to provide the guidelines on secure system
    architecture and engineering principles that are established in the organization.



2. Scope
    This procedure is applicable to all new and existing systems and application
    architecture developed at Trianz.

    The procedure applies to all managed Trianz products and services.



3. Security Principles
      •   Security Foundation
      •   Risk Based
      •   Ease of Use
      •   Increase Flexibility
      •   Reduce Vulnerabilities
      •   Security by design
      •   Defense in depth
      •   Security by default
      •   Fail Securely
      •   Never trust inputs from external sources or applications
      •   Secure deployment
      •   Always assume breach - design or implement controls accordingly.
      •   Always follow least privilege or default deny rules.
      •   Always design usability and manageability and least functionality in mind.




4. Security Foundation
          The principles related to Security foundation are specified below




TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                     4
       • To establish a sound security policy as the “foundation”, the Information
         Security Policy is defined and implemented. The policy identifies security
         objectives like
       • To ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability of critical information at
         all times
       • To protect information assets
       • To protect critical information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure,
         modification, and disposal, whether intentional or unintentional
       • To Implement security requirements from the initial level of the project
         initiation
       • Understanding the security requirements
       • Implementation of security requirements such as
       • User authentication
       • Secure session controls
       • LDAP authentication
       • Role based security implemented
       • Rule or Role or attribute based access control with least privilege or default
         deny policy.
       • Tracking the user activities while changing the data
       • Data is encrypted at database level to avoid the access to other users
       • User activities are tracking while read access at database level. (Query
         band implementation)
       • Participating in the evaluation of security products
       • Define physical and logical security boundaries
       • Physical Access – Access control mechanism is implemented
       • Logical access at application or product level is provided based on the
         requirements
       • Ensure that project team to develop and validate secure application
       • Define security standards like encryption algorithms to be used, etc as per
          the project requirements
       • Train the team on the defined standards
       • Periodically perform Threat Modeling on the applications and cover all the
          known threats, attack patterns and vulnerabilities as per Threat Modeling
          procedure.

       • Security shall be designed and integrated at all architecture layers (DB,
         network, application, platform etc.)
       • Implement DLP and Dynamic access management wherever required.
       • Always follow secure design principles and perform security-oriented
         design reviews.
       • Follow system hardening procedures and perform TVM regularly.
       • Trianz shall design or architecture information systems by following zero-
         trust principles in mind.
       • Wherever possible use immutable infrastructure.




5. Risk Based
       • Perform Risk Assessment, the risk treatment should ensure the risk handling
         for reducing the risk to acceptable level which is applicable for all projects
       • Based on the risk assessment, all the required controls like encryption,
         integrity checks, digital signatures, data validation, tokenization,
         anonymization, Pseudonymization need to be implemented.
       • Implement control that can detect, prevent and respond to security events,
          incidents, attacks.




6. Secure Development
       • Secure Development shall adopt "Microsoft Secure Development
         guidelines" or an equivalent methodology of Secure Software Development
          Life Cycle.




7. Secure Implementation


       • Multilayer access approach implementation can protect an asset from
         unauthorized access or modification


TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                     6
       • By Implementing layered security, the project team will protect application
         layer, Database layer, Integration layer and Data
       • Application layer will be protected like LDAP authentication, Credentials
       • Technical review compliance will be verified by Delivery Assurance in check
         points and toll gates




8. Ease of Use


       • Where possible, base security on open standards for portability and
         interoperability will be implemented
       • Use common language in developing security requirements
       • Design security to allow for regular adoption of new technology, new
         platforms and including a secure and logical technology upgrade process


9. Reduce Vulnerabilities


       • Identify and prevent common errors and vulnerabilities, such as buffer
         overflows, race conditions, format string errors, failing to check input for
         validity, and programs being given excessive privileges.
       • Implement profile or role privileges which will reduce risk by limiting the
         number of people with access to critical system security controls
       • Implementing role-based access controls for various aspects
       • Controlling who is allowed to enable or disable system security features or
         change the privileges of users or programs
       • Application vulnerabilities like crosstie scripting, SQL injection and etc. can
          be reduced by following the coding standards like prepared statements in
          Java and during testing also can be identified by the browser plug-ins like
          tamper IE
       • SSL implementation for secure transactions, by installing SSL certificates
