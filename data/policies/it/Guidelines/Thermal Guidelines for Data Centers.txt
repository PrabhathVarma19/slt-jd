  Hygro-Thermometer                      A device used to measure the relative
                                         humidity andtemperature

2. Temperature and Relative Humidity Measurement

The temperature and relative humidity will be measured by Hygro-Thermometer
placed inside the data center.
      •    The measured details will be noted down by the Security Personnel in the
           format mentioned in Appendix A, with a frequency of 2 Hrs. on all
           weekdays and weekends including company holidays (24/7)

      •    The acceptable range for temperature and relative humidity of Trianz
           data center are as given below:


                   Measurement                   Trianz Acceptable Range
            Temperature (°C)                           15 °C to 25°C
            Relative Humidity(%RH)                    20% to 80% RH


      •    If the Temperature/Relative humidity if found to be out of allowable
           range, the security personnel will inform the same to IT Administrator
           through phone.
