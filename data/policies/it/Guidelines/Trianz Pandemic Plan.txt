         9. Business continuity strategies:


              9.1 Work from home model ( Remote Working)
      Working from Home model is deployed by assessing and testing the capability
      provided to our associates to work from a location apart from the designated Trianz
      offices or Trianz client offices (referred to as a ‘remote’ location subsequently), using
      Trianz assets and equipment, for a prolonged duration.

      Work from home strategy will be activated when the primary/Secondary facilities are
      inoperable due to

         •   Pandemic/epidemic.


              9.1.1 Information technology Assets
      Trianz will provide official laptops, headphones and other peripherals. Connectivity to
      Trianz network or email can happen only after IS configuration for Trianz environment



       TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                       12
is done. Any request for such equipment will need to be authorized by Project
/Delivery manager.




        9.1.2 Power and network connectivity
All associates working from home must have continuous power and sufficient power
backups. Trianz has provided power backups like UPS to identified critical employees
in the projects/functions.

All associates are equipped with sufficient broadband internet connectivity and
backup internet dongles provided by the company.


        9.1.3 Security requirements
   •   All identified associates who qualify to work from home must clear – All
       mandatory security trainings (Information Security, Data privacy etc.) before
       availing work from home.
   •   All associates must follow and adhere to the remote cybersecurity guidelines
       published by the information security team.
   •   All work from home users are to comply with policies specified under
       information security management system in the Bluebook.



10. Hybrid Model
The hybrid working model is -flexible arrangement, allowing employees to work
remotely while others work on-premises with suitable preventive controls.



A 'hybrid' model of working achieves both of these:

   •   It provides the businesses with the structure and sociability in an office
       environment
   •   Flexibility and independence of remote working.
