1. Purpose
     •       The purpose of this policy is that all applications must implement
             adequate security measures to protect the Confidentiality, Integrity, and
             Availability of data at rest, in use or in motion.
     •       The application security policy defines the security framework and
             requirements for applications, notably API & web applications, within
             Trianz’s production environment.


2. Objective
     •       The objective of this policy is to provide guidance and support to project,
             products and development teams in delivering secure applications to
             support the Trianz’s business while expediting the security assessment
             and testing process required to validate new application releases
             ensuring they are free of vulnerabilities that would put the production
             environment at risk.


3. Scope
         •   All applications that pass or store data owned by Trianz are subject to this
             policy. This policy applies to all applications within Trianz’s production
             environment, as well as administrators and users of these applications.
         •   All externally accessible public facing applications, internally accessible
             mission critical applications, and vendor customizable Commercial Off-
             The-Shelf (COTS) or in-house developed applications and cloud-based
             applications are included within the scope of this document.
         •   The policy is applicable for all Trianz products and services.


4. Policy Statements
   Secure development practices will be established, implemented, and
   documented for all applications developed or purchased to include appropriate
   security controls to prevent unauthorized access or modification of the system
   or information coded or stored.




TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                          4
4.1   Application Security Metrics
      Technical and operational metrics shall be implemented according to business
      objectives and security requirements.
       Refer to Trianz Metrics Strategy document.


4.2 Data Security
      Protecting data’s confidentiality, integrity, availability and privacy. Privacy is a
      principle that must be maintained at all times. Proper encryption solutions must
      be implemented to protect data at rest, in use or in motion.


4.3 Access Control
      All access to Trianz’s systems must be authorized and based on individual
      identification and authentication. Application logs are to be designed to
      showcase application user activity audit trails.


4.4 Infrastructure Security
      •    Application hosting solutions must comply with the Trianz’s security
           policies and standards and have a Service Level Agreement defined with
           the infrastructure provider.
      •    The infrastructure environment, IAAC, Container images must be scanned
           on a periodic basis to identify security vulnerabilities, misconfiguration or
           missing security patches. (Vulnerability Management Policy).
      •    For cloud or Software as a Service solutions (SaaS) third party vendors
           must provide evidence that periodic security scans, assessments or
           audits are conducted on their infrastructure environment and findings are
           addressed in a timely manner.



4.5 Application Environment
      •    Infrastructure environments hosting application binaries or source code
           must have security mechanisms in place to prevent unauthorized access
           and modification of resources or data.
      •    Change control procedures must be defined to ensure that only
           authorized changes after passing through the required phase gates,
           approved by the business and reviewed by the Trianz’s Information


 TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                        5
          Security & Data Privacy Assurance team, can be released in a production
          environment. (C.f. Change Management Policy). Deviation in the phase
          gates would need approval from internal & external stakeholders.
          Development & testing activities should not be conducted in production
          environment. No production data can be used for trouble shooting in
          non-production environment. Engineering team members should not be
          provided access to the production environment. If there’s specific
          production access required for trouble shooting, same is to be provided
          temporarily with required deviation approval.
     •     Separation of duties must be implemented to protect the production
          environment from unauthorized access or modification.
     •    A risk assessment shall be performed prior to production for all
          applications that will store, access, create, and/or transmit confidential or
          protected information.



4.6 Security Assessment and Releases to Production
     •    All modifications of the application must go through a change release
          process that includes an appropriate security assessment (automated
          security scanning or manual testing) to identify potential risk and security
          impacts to the current production environment.
     •    Any application change being deployed in a production environment must
          ensure compliance with the Trianz’s security policies, standards, and best
          practices. Successful completion of the security assessment is
          acknowledged by the Trianz’s CIO or CISO, and must be achieved prior to
          launch in production.
     •    Each release must have a defined roll-back plan in case its migration to
          the production environment causes service degradation.



      4.6.1 Security Assessment Level
             The following security assessment levels are established.
                ▪ Full assessments test for all known web application vulnerabilities
                     using both automated and manual tools. A full assessment will
                   use manual penetration testing techniques to validate
                   discovered vulnerabilities and determine the overall risk of those
                   vulnerabilities.



TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                      6
                  ▪   Quick assessments will at a minimum consist of an automated
                      scan for the OWASP Top Ten web application security risks.



        4.6.2 Releases to production
             •    Releases to a production environment are approved based on the
                  vulnerabilities found during the security assessment.
             •    All security issues that are discovered during assessments or
                  identified by the Trianz’s Software Security Assurance Tool must be
                  mitigated based upon the following risk levels, which are based on
                  the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).
             •    Remediation validation testing will be required to validate fix and/or
                  mitigation strategies for any discovered issues of medium risk level or
                  greater.



4.7 Business Continuity
    •    Application business owners must ensure that each application has a defined
         Business Continuity Plan and a Disaster Recovery Plan to ensure its readiness
         to respond to events that could disrupt the application’s service continuity.
    •    Back-up & recovery plans and solutions shall be designed according to
         business requirements.
    •    For services provided by Third Party vendors, business owners must define the
         provider’s Service Level Agreement (SLA) with these requirements taken into
         consideration.


4.8 Application End of Life
    •    Decommissioning an application requires the same security precautions as
         maintaining it in production.
    •    Regulatory requirements about data retention and destruction must be
         considered as application is decommissioned.
    •    If an application cannot maintain compliance with the Trianz’s policies and
         standards.
    •    Trianz’s CIO/CISO may provide binding recommendations to mitigate
         outstanding risks.
