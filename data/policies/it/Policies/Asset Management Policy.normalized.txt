## 1. Introduction
Asset Management is the process of identifying, classifying, managing, recording, and coordinating Trianz assets to ensure their security and the continued protection of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. An 'Asset' is defined as any item, system, application, or entity that has potential or actual value to Trianz.

## 2. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to manage organizational assets (tangible and intangible) and document those assets to ensure knowledge and understanding of their value, purpose, risk, and location. 

- All assets must be assigned an Information Asset Owner (IAO) responsible for managing, updating, recording, and destroying the asset.
- The nature and value of every asset must be documented to enable Trianz to:
  - Restrict access where applicable.
  - Develop effective recovery and continuity programs.
  - Optimize spending.
  - Support lifecycle management.
  - Facilitate strategic decision-making.
  - Protect the interests and assets belonging to customers and clients.
  
An Information Asset Register (IAR) is utilized to identify, document, and map all information assets, assigning them an owner. Cloud assets are managed and controlled by Cloud Administrators.

## 3. Scope
- This policy applies to all assets at Trianz located on premises, offshore, client premises, and cloud infrastructure.
- Client-specific information classification policies shall supersede this policy for specific engagements as per client contractual requirements.

## 4. Objectives
The objectives of this policy are to ensure proper asset classification and handling:

- Individuals with a legitimate right to access information can do so, while protecting assets from unauthorized access.
- All assets must be handled and managed according to their classification.
- Trianz assets should be available to all who have a legitimate need to access them.
- The integrity of information must be maintained; it must be accurate, complete, timely, and consistent with related information and events.
- All Trianz employees with access to assets are responsible for handling them according to asset classification.
- Asset owners must ensure compliance with the Trianz classification scheme.

### 7. Information Labelling, Handling, and Disposal
