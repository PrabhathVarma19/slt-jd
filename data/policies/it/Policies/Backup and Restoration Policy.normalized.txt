### 5.2 Data Back Up

- IS Operations, delivery teams, and product teams are responsible for system support and data backup tasks. They must follow Trianz’s Disaster Recovery Procedures and Data Retention policies to ensure adequate backup and system recovery practices.
  
- All data must be systematically backed up, including updates necessary for system re-installation or configuration.

- Backup files must be encrypted and appropriately labeled. Systems managing backed-up files should store dates and codes/markings for easy identification of the original data source and backup type.

- All encryption keys must be securely stored, with clear procedures to ensure backup media can be promptly decrypted in the event of a disaster.

- If the data to be backed up contains Personal Data, Personal Sensitive Data, or Personally Identifiable Information, it must be anonymized or erased according to legal and regulatory requirements.

- A recording mechanism must be maintained to document all backup information, including function, data location, date, type of backup (e.g., Incremental, Full), and any failures or issues related to the backup job.

- Copies of backup media must be removed from devices as soon as possible after a backup or restore is completed.

- Access to the on-site backup location (either on-premises or cloud) must be restricted to authorized personnel only.

- Data stored on-premises or in the cloud must be backed up based on a defined frequency.

- Backup media must be protected in accordance with the Data Protection and Media Handling Policies.

- Backup data/media that is no longer required must be clearly marked and recorded for secure disposal, considering environmental factors.

### 5.3 Data Restoration

- Function Owners must request data restoration by contacting the IS Operations Service Desk or Project/Product infrastructure management team, preferably by raising a service ticket through the IS Service Desk online facility. Only files the user is authorized to access will be restored.

- The IS Operations Service Desk Team must verify the user's permission to view or obtain restored files. Restored content will be returned to the same source folder or area, requiring the requestor to have access to that location.

- Function Owners requesting a restore must provide detailed information about the data, including:
  - The reason for the restore.
  - The names of the files and/or folders to be restored.
  - The original location of the files and/or folders (guidance will be provided by the Service Desk).
  - The date, day, or time of deletion/corruption or the nearest approximation.
  - The last date, day, or time the user recalls the data being intact and successfully accessed.

- All backup and recovery procedures must be documented and made available to Data Centre personnel responsible for data restores.

- Requests from third-party software/hardware vendors for file or system restores must be made under the supervision of the Server Support Team via the IS Operations Service Desk.

- Personnel accessing backup media for restoration must return any used media to a secure location when no longer required.

- A log must be maintained to record the use of backup media whenever it is requested or used from secure storage.

### 5.4 Validation and Testing

  - Monthly  
  - The choice of frequency depends on the criticality and technical feasibility.  
- The type of data backup can be:
