## 1. Purpose
The use of resources shall be monitored, tuned, and projections made for future capacity requirements to ensure the required system performance. Capacity demands shall be monitored, and projections of future capacity requirements shall be made to enable adequate processing power and storage to be available.

## 2. Objective
The objective of Capacity Management is to understand the business requirements, the organization’s operations, and the IT infrastructure to ensure that all current and future capacity and performance aspects of the business requirements are provided cost-effectively.

## 3. Scope
- This policy applies to all Trianz Associates, Contractors, Vendors, Clients, Cloud Service Providers, Cloud Service Customers, and Products using Trianz IT infrastructure and communication services.
- The requirements of this policy shall be implemented in all systems under the ownership of Trianz, whether on-premises or in the cloud, and for all other Trianz managed systems, wherever applicable.
- It is applicable for all Trianz Products and services.

## 4. Policy Statements
- Capacity demands shall be monitored, and projections of future capacity requirements shall be made to enable adequate processing power and storage to be available.
- The IS team shall track the information processing needs of various users over time, in coordination with the respective Operations Manager. The Project Manager, along with the IS Team, will estimate the critical computer resources required and initiate hardware or software procurement. An indent will be raised to the finance department to acquire the new hardware or software.
- System tuning and monitoring shall be applied to ensure and, where necessary, improve the availability and efficiency of systems. Detective and preventive controls shall be implemented to indicate problems in a timely manner.
- Sufficient capacity shall be achieved by increasing capacity or optimizing resource utilization. Examples of managing capacity demand include:
  - Deletion of obsolete data (disk space).
  - Decommissioning of applications, systems, databases, or environments.
  - Optimizing batch processes and schedules.
  - Optimizing application logic or database queries.
  - Denying or restricting bandwidth for resource-hungry services if they are not business-critical (e.g., video streaming).
- For Cloud Services, computing systems adapt to workload changes by provisioning and de-provisioning resources automatically (Elastic Scaling) to ensure that available resources match current demand precisely. This involves dynamic adaptation of capacity to meet varying workloads, optimizing cost and utilization through Cloud Reservations and periodic reviews of consumption.
- In case of capacity constraints, such as the number of processor cores, available storage, or network bandwidth, either changing the subscription or changing the cloud service provider shall be considered.

### 1.1 4.1 Thresholds
- **Threshold Value**: Specific thresholds will be defined to monitor capacity and performance. Actions will be taken based on these thresholds as necessary.

### 2. Threshold Alerts

1. **Warning Alert**
   - When the value reaches 70%, a warning message will be emailed to IT Admins and stakeholders. Appropriate action will be initiated.

2. **High Alert**
   - When the value reaches 80%, a high alert message will be emailed to IT Admins. A Root Cause Analysis (RCA) will be performed, and immediate correction will be done. Corrective action will be identified and initiated.

3. **Critical Alert**
   - When the value reaches 90%, a critical alert message will be emailed to IT Admins. Capacity will be suitably enhanced.

### 5. Roles & Responsibilities

1. **Capacity Management - Cloud Provider**
   - Responsible for monitoring total capacity to prevent information security incidents caused by resource shortages.
