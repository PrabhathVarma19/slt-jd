1. Purpose
      The use of resources shall be monitored, tuned and projections made for future
      capacity requirements to ensure the required system Performance. Capacity
      demands shall be monitored, and projections of future capacity requirements
      shall be made to enable adequate processing power and storage is made
      available.

2. Objective
      The objective of Capacity Management is to understand the business
      requirements, the organization’s operations, and the IT infrastructure to ensure
      that all the current and future capacity and performance aspects of the
      business requirements are provided cost-effectively.

3. Scope
•     This policy applies to all Trianz Associates, Contractors, and Vendors, Clients,
      Cloud Service Providers, Cloud Service Customers, Products and who are using
      Trianz IT infrastructure and communication services.

•     The requirements of this policy shall be implemented in all the systems under
      the ownership of Trianz, either on premises or on cloud and for all other Trianz
      managed systems, wherever applicable.

•     It is applicable for all Trianz Products and services.

4. Policy Statements
•     Capacity demands shall be monitored, and projections of future capacity
      requirements shall be made to enable adequate processing power and
      storage to be made available.

•     IS team shall keep a track of information processing needs of various users
      from time to time. This is done in coordination with the respective operations
      Manager. As a part of an engagement, project Manager along with IS Team
      will estimate the critical computer resources required and hardware or
      software procurement. Indent will be raised to the finance department to
      acquire the new hardware or software.

•     In addition to the above, System-tuning and monitoring shall be applied to
      ensure and, where necessary, to improve the availability and efficiency of



    TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                      4
      systems, Detective & preventive controls shall be put in place to indicate
      problems in due time.

•     Sufficient capacity shall be achieved by increasing capacity or by optimizing
      resource utilization. Examples of managing capacity demand include:

      a) Deletion of obsolete data (disk space);

      b) Decommissioning of applications, systems, databases or environments;

      c) Optimizing batch processes and schedules;

      d) Optimizing application logic or database queries;

    e) Denying or restricting bandwidth for resource-hungry services if these are not
      business critical (e.g. video streaming).

•     For Cloud Services, computing systems adapt to workload changes by
      provisioning and de-provisioning resources in an automatic manner (Elastic
      Scaling), such that at each point in time the available resources match the
      current demand precisely, it is dynamic adaptation of capacity, by altering the
      use of computing resources, to meet varying workload. To optimize cost and
      utilization by using Cloud Reservations and periodical review of the
      consumption.

•     In case of capacity constraints such as the number of Processor core
      applications, the amount of storage available, the network bandwidth
      availability – either changing the subscription or changing the cloud service
      provider shall be considered.
