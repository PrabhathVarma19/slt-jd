### 4.2 Interoperability

#### 4.2.1 Cloud Interoperability Facets
- Interoperability is not a binary concept; it is implemented based on multiple elements.
- The interoperability facet model defined by ISO/IEC 19941:2017 includes five facets: 
  1. Transport
  2. Syntactic
  3. Semantic Data
  4. Behavioral
  5. Policy
- Trianz Associates must consider these facets when implementing or evaluating a Cloud solution.

#### 4.2.2 Facets of Cloud Interoperability

**Transport Interoperability:**
- Transport interoperability involves a common communication infrastructure for data exchange between systems.
- It includes transfer mechanisms between CSC components and CSP components, or between CSP components of different cloud services.
- Examples of standard transport interoperability protocols include:
  - REST-based HTTP/S
  - SOAP
  - Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)
  - Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)
- Identified network/transport protocols must meet industry-accepted cryptographic security standards.

**Syntactic Interoperability:**
- Syntactic interoperability is the ability of multiple cloud systems or services to understand the structure of exchanged information.
- Examples of encoding syntaxes include:
  - JSON
  - XML
  - ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation 1)

**Semantic Data Interoperability:**
- Semantic data interoperability allows systems exchanging information to understand the meaning of the data model within a subject area.
- At the infrastructure level, this includes virtual machines (VMs), containers, storage, and networking concepts.
- At the application level, domain concepts are defined by the application (e.g., Customer Service Management (CSM), Human Capital Management (HCM), Customer Relationship Management (CRM)).
- At the business domain level, it involves sharing and understanding discrete domain concepts between applications, using approaches like:
  - Construction of ontologies (e.g., OWL)
  - Use of semantic query languages (e.g., SPARQL)

**Behavioral Interoperability:**
- Behavioral interoperability is defined in the service description, which includes the API interface declaration.
- The API describes the service in terms of operations, inputs, and outputs.
- Additional information required includes expected results, pre-conditions, post-conditions, and necessary sequences of operations for successful API use.
- This facet abstracts from implementation details and describes the behavior of software components in a representation-independent manner.

### 4.2.6 Policy Interoperability

- Policy interoperability is the ability of two or more systems to work together while adhering to applicable legal, organizational, and policy frameworks.
- This includes compliance with governmental laws, regulations from regulatory bodies, and the policy terms of Cloud Service Providers (CSP) and Cloud Service Customers (CSC).
- Specific security requirements may be necessary based on the nature of the data being processed. For example:
  - When handling credit card information, the cloud service must comply with the PCI-DSS standard.
  - General security requirements may include certification against standards such as ISO/IEC 27001 or ISO/IEC 27017.

### 4.3 Cloud Data Portability

#### 4.3.1 Cloud Data Portability Facet Model

- Cloud data portability refers to the ability to transfer data from one cloud service to another or from a CSC’s system to a cloud service using a machine-readable format.
- Data portability can be analyzed through different facets, each focusing on a specific dimension. To achieve data portability, all facets must be understood and mutually agreed upon to identify which facet may require attention during data transfer. 
- The facets include:
  - Data policy
  - Data syntactic
  - Data semantic

### 4.3 Data Portability

#### 4.3.2 Data Syntactic Portability:
- Data syntactic portability involves transferring data from a source system to a target system using formats that can be decoded on the target system.
- Acceptable encoding syntaxes include XML and packaging formats such as Open Virtualization Format (OVF) or Zip.

#### 4.3.3 Data Semantic Portability:
- Data semantic portability is the transfer of data to a target system where the meaning of the data model is understood within the relevant subject area.
- A data model (Metadata) includes data items, attributes, logical structures, and relationships between data items.
- Data models are influenced by the type of cloud service offering:
  - At the infrastructure level, they pertain to VMs, containers, storage, and networking metadata.
  - At the application level, they are dictated by the specific application, such as CSM, CRM, or ERP.

#### 4.3.4 Data Policy Portability:
- Data policy portability refers to the ability to transfer data between a source and a target while adhering to applicable legal, organizational, and policy frameworks.

### 4.4.3 Application Instruction Portability
- Application instruction portability involves migrating an application from a source system to a target system, ensuring that its instruction set executes correctly on the target system.
- After porting, all software artifacts, orchestration instructions, and scripts must be executed on infrastructure that mimics the original system, requiring all necessary interpreters and execution engines to be available.

### 4.4.4 Application Metadata Portability
- Application metadata portability refers to migrating an application from a source system to a target system, ensuring that the application metadata is comprehensible on the target system.
- The domain model of the application must be mutually understood between the source and target systems, including metadata about required resources, configuration, and initialization data.

### 4.4.5 Application Behavior Portability
- Application behavior portability is the process of migrating an application from a source to a target system, ensuring that execution on the target produces results equivalent to those from the source.
- Differences in execution environments may lead to variations in application behavior, particularly when porting from a legacy system to a cloud-native environment.

### 4.2.1 Application Policy Portability
- Application policy portability is defined as the migration of an application from a source system to a target system while adhering to the relevant legal, organizational, and policy frameworks of both systems.
- Challenges in policy portability may include:
  - Lack of payment for cloud services.
