### 2.11 Logging and Monitoring Security Incidents

- Requirements for logging and monitoring must be documented.
- Critical events, such as deletion, table drop, or granting privilege login, must be identified and monitored independently, which can be achieved by enabling email alerts to the Cloud service manager and security team.
- Log details must provide a complete trail, including login name, date, time, IP address, location, and activities performed.
- Health checks must be performed by the Cloud Service Provider.
- Event logs must record whether any personal data or personally identifiable information has been changed (added, modified, or deleted) as a result of an event and by whom.
- Criteria must be defined regarding if, when, and how log information can be made available to or used by clients.
- When clients are permitted to access log records, access must be limited to records related to that specific client's activities.
- Controlled (restricted) access to log information must be ensured for defined purposes when it contains personally identifiable information, personal data, or sensitive personal data.
- All system time must be synchronized to a central NTP server, wherever feasible, to aid in reconciling events on the Cloud service systems during investigations or maintaining the chain of custody.
