## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that users do not send sensitive or critical information outside the corporate network. Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is the practice of detecting and preventing data breaches, exfiltration, or unwanted destruction of sensitive data.

## 2. Scope
The scope of the policy includes:
1. Network DLP
2. End Point DLP
3. Cloud DLP
4. Storage DLP

## 3. Objective
The objective of this policy is to ensure data protection and incident prevention for Trianz’s business-critical data and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data, which includes sensitive data as per applicable regulations.

## 4. Policy
- Trianz shall adopt a DLP solution that includes data identification and classification to meet complex and evolving compliance standards.
- DLP must be implemented across:
  - **Network**: Prevent, monitor, and control the flow of information, including PII data, via the company’s network, email, or web.
  - **Endpoint**: Monitor endpoint devices (servers, computers, laptops, and mobile devices) where Trianz’s critical information is used, moved, and stored.
  - **Cloud**: Protect data stored in the cloud by encrypting sensitive data and ensuring it is sent only to authorized cloud applications.
  - **Storage**: Protect unstructured data on servers and structured data in databases.
- The DLP solution must be fully integrated within Trianz’s cybersecurity architecture.

## 5. Monitoring
The IS operation team shall implement required solutions and constantly monitor and analyze data to identify potential violations of security policies.

## 6. Compliance
The InfoSec and Data Privacy Assurance Team will verify compliance with this policy through internal and external audits.

## 7. Exception(s)
Exceptions to the Data Loss Prevention policy shall follow the Exception handling policy, such as for Finance and HR data with adequate safeguards.

## 8. ISO Clause Mapping

  - **8.11 Data Masking Control**: Data masking shall be used in accordance with the organization's topic-specific policy on access control and other related policies, considering applicable legislation.
