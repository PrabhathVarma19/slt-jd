1. Purpose
    The purpose of this Exception Handling Policy is to establish a structured approach for
    identifying, reporting, analysing, and resolving exceptions within the organization. This
    ensures timely resolution, minimizes security risks, and maintains operational efficiency
    while complying with legal, regulatory, and organizational requirements.


2. Scope
    This policy applies to all the published Trianz’s defined policy, procedure and guidelines. This
    policy does not apply to any of the policies or procedures published by groups outside of
    Trianz Information Security Management System.



3. Policy Statement
    An exception to the ISMS/PIMS practices may be granted by Product/Project Manager, IT
    Manager and CISO, if required for non-compliance resulting from:

•   Implementation of a solution with equivalent protection.
•   Implementation of a solution with superior protection.
•   Impending retirement of a legacy system.
•   Inability to implement the standard due to some limitation
➢ Exceptions are granted for a specific period, not exceeding one month to three months or
  the end of the contract, whichever is earlier. Exceptions are reviewed on a case-by-case
  basis and their approval renewal is not automatic.
➢ The exception review process must log all findings and results in a central repository
➢ Approved exceptions must be periodically reviewed semi-annually by Information systems,
    InfoSec and compliance, and the unit requesting the exception.



4. Exception Request
    All Exception Requests should be logged in the control doc under the exception request
    feature. All requests will go via service desk team to for the first level reporting Manager
    Approval and then IT manager approval.
•   Exception ticket creation > IS Help Desk > Reporting Manager Approval > IT
    Manager Approval (Can decide for further Approval required or not) if ‘Yes’ > CISO
    for final approval / rejection.
•   An exception requestor should review and work with IS team and InfoSec and compliance
    team member to:
➢ Assess the risks created by the exception,

TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                                    4
➢ Evaluate potential alternatives,
➢ Attain recommendations.

   The Exception Request must include:
   ▪   Description of the non-compliance
   ▪   Anticipated length of non-compliance
   ▪   Assessment of risk associated with the requested non-compliance
   ▪   Proposed plan for managing the risk associated with non-compliance
   ▪   Proposed metrics for evaluating the success of risk management
   ▪   Proposed review date to evaluate progress toward compliance
   ▪   Approval of the exception request by the Project manager/Function head by email and
       duly signed in the exception request form.
   •   After InfoSec has reviewed the request and confirmed the details of the requested
       exception, the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) will review and
       approve/reject.
   •   If the non-compliance is due to a superior solution, an exception will normally be
       granted until the published standard or procedure can be revised to include the new
       solution. An exception request must still be submitted.
