## 1. Purpose
This policy establishes requirements for the collection, maintenance, and review of audit logs for Trianz applications and related network resources, supporting identity management and threat monitoring. Audit logs track and associate user and system activity to events.

## 2. Scope
This policy covers all Trianz assets currently available or that may be created or used in the future. All Trianz employees, contractors, and other stakeholders are responsible for understanding and complying with this policy.

## 3. Policy Statement
- Trianz shall identify systems, applications, or processes that make data vulnerable to unauthorized or inappropriate tampering, uses, or disclosures.
- For each identified system, application, or process, Trianz shall identify user activities (e.g., Create, Read, Update, Delete) that need to be tracked and audited.
- Logging shall include system, application, and database & file activity whenever available or deemed necessary.
- Logging shall include:
  - Creation, access, modification, and deletion activities.
- Log files shall be regularly examined for:
  - Access control discrepancies
  - Breaches
  - Policy violations
- Data custodians or device managers are responsible for developing appropriate processes for monitoring and analyzing their logs.
- Individuals shall not be assigned to be the sole reviewers of their own user activity.
- System activity review cycles shall include:
  - Review of audit logs minimally every 30 days
  - Daily exception reporting may be included.
- The Information Systems team shall be responsible for monitoring and reviewing audit logs to identify and respond to inappropriate or unusual activity.

## 4. Measurement and Review
Audit logging records system and user activities used for system performance tuning, detecting unauthorized access, and investigating incidents.

### 4.1 Log Reporting
Logs must be configured to report key events, including:
- Individual access to private data (e.g., file system, application)
- Actions taken by individuals with root or administrative privileges
- Access to audit trails
- Invalid logical access attempts (e.g., authentication failures, ACL issues, missing web pages, web server errors)
- Use of identification and authentication mechanisms
- Initialization of audit logs
- Use of privileges (e.g., sudo, UAC, elevated privileges)
- Activation and deactivation of protection systems (e.g., anti-virus, intrusion detection systems)

Log report key entries must include:
- User identification
- Type of event
- Date and time
- Success and failure indication
- Origination of the event
- Identity or name of affected private data or system
- Network addresses and protocols

Additionally, clocks must be synchronized to the Trianz NTP servers.

### 4.2 Logging Security-Related Events
- Security-related events/incidents must be logged in the control dock tool.
- The Information Security Compliance team will review these events and prescribe corrective measures.

### 4.2 Security-Related Events
Security-related events include, but are not limited to:
- Brute force attempts
- Accounts that have been automatically locked due to failed attempts
- Multiple simultaneous login events from any geo-locations
- Port scan attacks
- Evidence of unauthorized access
- Anomalous occurrences that are not related to specific applications on the host
- Theft of computing equipment

### 4.3 Log Review and Retention
- Review logs and security events for all system components to identify anomalies or suspicious activity.
- Review the following at least daily:
  - All security events
  - Logs of all system components that store, process, or transmit Cardholder Data (CHD) and/or Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD)
  - Logs of all critical system components
  - Logs of all servers and system components that perform security functions (e.g., firewalls, intrusion-detection systems/intrusion-prevention systems (IDS/IPS), authentication servers, e-commerce redirection servers, etc.)
- Review logs from all other system components periodically based on the organization’s policies and risk management strategy, as determined by the organization’s annual risk assessment.
- Automation can improve the review and analysis of logs; however, log reduction, review, and reporting tools should support log analysis without altering original log records.
- All physical and logical access logs, audit trails, etc., shall be retained for a minimum of five years.

### 5 Compliance and Monitoring
- Use file-integrity monitoring or change-detection software on logs to ensure that existing log data cannot be changed without generating alerts (new data being added should not cause an alert).
- Write logs for external-facing technologies onto a secure, centralized, internal log server or media device.
- Promptly back up audit trail files to a centralized log server or media that is difficult to alter.
- Set proper permissions on log files and use a separate server (Central Syslogger) to store all log files.
- Make regular backups of the log files and encrypt log files.
