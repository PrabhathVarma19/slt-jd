1. Purpose
  This policy establishes requirements for the collection, maintenance and review of
  audit logs for Trianz applications and related network resources, in support of
  identity management and threat monitoring. Audit logs consist of information trails
  that are used to track and associate user and system activity to events.



2. Scope
  This policy covers all Trianz assets which is available currently, or which may be
  created, used in the future. All Trianz employees, contractors and other
  stakeholders are responsible for understanding and complying with this policy.



3. Policy Statement
  Trianz shall identify the systems, applications, or processes that make data vulnerable
  to unauthorized or inappropriate tampering, uses or disclosures. For each identified
  system, application, or process. Trianz shall identify user activities (e.g. Create, Read,
  Update, and Delete) that needs to be tracked and audited.

  Logging shall include system, application, and database & file activity whenever
  available or deemed necessary.

  •   Logging shall include creation, access, modification and deletion activities.
  •   Log files shall be regularly examined for access control discrepancies,
      breaches, and policy violations.
  •   Data custodians or device managers are responsible for developing
      appropriate processes for monitoring and analyzing their logs.
  •   Individuals shall not be assigned to be the sole reviewers of their own user
      activity.
  •   System activity review cycles shall include review of audit logs minimally every
      30 days and may include daily exception reporting.
  •   The Information Systems team shall be responsible for monitoring and
      reviewing audit logs to identify and respond to inappropriate or unusual
      activity.
  •   Browser Weakness and Updates




TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                       4
4 Measurement and Review
 Audit logging records system and user activities used for system performance
 tuning, detecting unauthorized access and to investigate incidents.


    4.1 Log Reporting
          Configure logs to be of sufficient size to reporting key events such as:

          •   Individual access to private data (e.g., file system, application)
          •   Actions taken by an individual with root or administrative privileges
          •   Access to audit trails
          •   Invalid logical access attempts (e.g., authentication, ACL, missing web
              page, web server error)
          •   Use of identification and authentication mechanism
          •   Initialization of audit logs
          •   Use of privileges (e.g., sudo, UAC, elevated use of privileges)
          •   Activation and de-activation of protection systems, such as anti-virus
              and intrusion detection systems
          •   Configure log report key entries to include:

              ➢   user identification
              ➢   type of event
              ➢   date and time
              ➢   success and failure indication
              ➢   origination of the event
              ➢   identity or name of affected private data, or system
              ➢   network addresses and protocols

          •   Synchronize the clock to the Trianz NTP servers.


    4.2 Logging Security-Related Events
          Security-related events/incidents must be logged in the control dock tool.
          Also, the Information Security Compliance team will review these events and
          prescribe corrective measures as needed.

          Security-related events include, but are not limited to:

          •   Brute force attempts


TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                         5
           •     Accounts that have been automatically locked due to failed attempts
           •     Multiple simultaneous login events from any geo-locations
           •     Port scan attacks
           •     Evidence of unauthorized access
           •     Anomalous occurrences that are not related to specific applications on
           the host
           •     Theft of computing equipment


    4.3 Log Review and Retention
       •       Review logs and security events for all system components to identify
               anomalies or suspicious activity.
       •       Review the following at least daily:
                  •   All security events
                  •   Logs of all system components that store, process, or transmit CHD
                      and/or SAD
                  •   Logs of all critical system components
                  •   Logs of all servers and system components that perform security
                      functions      (for      example,    firewalls,    intrusion-detection
                      systems/intrusion-prevention systems (IDS/IPS), authentication
                      servers, e-commerce redirection servers, etc.)
       •       Review logs from all other system components periodically based on the
               organization’s policies and risk management strategy, as determined by
               the organization’s annual risk assessment.
       •       Automation can improve the review and analysis of logs. However, log
               reduction, review, and reporting tools should support log analysis without
               altering original log records
       •       All physical and logical access logs, audit trails etc. shall be retained for a
               minimum of five years.

5 Compliance and Monitoring
  •   Use file-integrity monitoring or change-detection software on logs to ensure
      that existing log data cannot be changed without generating alerts (although
      new data being added should not cause an alert)
  •   Write logs for external-facing technologies onto a secure, centralized, internal
      log server or media device
  •   Promptly back up audit trail files to a centralized log server or media that is
      difficult to alter
  •   Set proper permissions on log files and use a separate server (Central
      Syslogger) to store all log files
  •   Make regular backups of the log files and encrypt log files.
