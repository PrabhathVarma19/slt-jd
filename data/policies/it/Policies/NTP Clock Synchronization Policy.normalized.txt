## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to define the requirement that all network, server, and cloud infrastructure in Trianz deploy a time synchronization service to ensure consistent usage of time for logging. The clocks of all relevant information processing systems within an organization or security domain should be synchronized to a single reference time source.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all Trianz network, server, cloud infrastructure, and communication services. The requirements of this policy shall be implemented in all systems under the ownership of Trianz, either on premises or on cloud, and for all other Trianz managed systems, wherever applicable.

## 3. Policy Statements
- All systems covered by the scope of this policy must deploy clock synchronization technology to ensure consistent and usable timestamps for activity logging wherever feasible.
- All systems should use Trianz Network Time Protocol (NTP) to synchronize each server’s clock with the NTP server.
- All Active Directory connected systems may synchronize time from their domain controllers if those domain controllers are synchronized to the central NTP server.
- The time server should use access control and authentication facilities in NTP to restrict access to enhance security from threats within the firewall.
- For communicating with the time server for status and control, use a secure protocol such as Secure Shell (latest version) and/or encrypted Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP, latest version).
- Utilize at least two or more NTP servers, with three or more strongly recommended, with the lowest possible stratum to minimize or eliminate timing errors.
- Include at least two reference sources for input. NTP can select the best candidates to estimate the current time and error, even when a network connection is temporarily unavailable.
- Block non-authenticated ports at the firewall to enhance network perimeter security, as NTP is founded on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and is highly susceptible to IP spoofing.
- Audit logs with correct clock synchronization shall assist in investigations or serve as evidence in legal or disciplinary cases.
- Control of Clock Synchronization remains the same for Standard 27018.
- NTP shall be synchronized as per the global standard.

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities
1. **Clock Synchronization**
   - **Roles**: IS Operations/product teams
   - **Responsibility**: Shall have the authority to implement and maintain this policy. As a Cloud Service Provider, shall provide information to the Cloud Service Team about the clock used and how clients can synchronize their local clocks with the Cloud Service Clock.

### 1. Cloud Service Customer Responsibilities
- The Cloud Service Customer shall request information from the Cloud Provider regarding the clock synchronization used for the Cloud Provider’s systems.

### 2. Audit & Compliance
- Annual Policy & Compliance Review is required.

### 5. Exceptions
- There are currently no exceptions to this policy. Any exceptions to the NTP Clock Synchronization policy must adhere to the Exception Handling Policy.

### 6. ISO Control Mapping
- **Category of Control**: Technological Control
  - **ISO 27001:2022 Control**: 8.17 Clock synchronization
  - **Document Name as per ISO 27001:2022**: NTP Clock Synchronization Policy
  - **Control Requirement**: The clocks of information processing systems used by the organization shall be synchronized to approved time sources.
