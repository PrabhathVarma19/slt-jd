1. Purpose
   The purpose of this policy is to define the requirement that all network, server and
      cloud infrastructure in Trianz deploy a time synchronization service to ensure
      consistent usage of time for logging. The clocks of all relevant information
      processing systems within an organization or security domain should be
      synchronized to a single reference time source



2. Scope
      This policy applies to all Trianz network, server, cloud infrastructure and
      communication services.

      The requirements of this policy shall be implemented in all the systems under the
      ownership of Trianz, either on premises or on cloud and for all other Trianz
      managed systems, wherever applicable.



3. Policy Statements
  •     All systems covered by the scope of this policy must deploy clock
        synchronization technology to ensure consistent and usable timestamps for
        activity logging wherever feasible.
  •     At present, this means that all systems should use Trianz Network Time Protocol
        (NTP) to synchronize each server’s clock with the NTP server.
  •     All Active Directory connected systems may synchronize time from their domain
        controllers if those domain controllers are synchronized to the central NTP
        server.

  •    To enhance security from threats contained within the firewall, the time server
       should use the access control and authentication facilities in NTP to restrict
       access to the service.
  •    For communicating with the time server for status and control it is best to use a
       secure protocol such as Secure Shell (Current latest version) and/or Simple
       Network Management Protocol (SNMP) current latest version (encrypted SNMP).
  •    Utilize at least two or more (three or more is strongly recommended) NTP
       servers with the lowest possible stratum to minimize/eliminate timing errors.
  •    Include at least two reference sources for the input. Having available several
       time sources, NTP can select the best candidates to build its estimate of the
       current time. Even when a network connection is temporarily unavailable, NTP
       can use measurements from the past to estimate current time and error.
  •    NTP is founded on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and is highly susceptible
       to IP spoofing, so blocking the non-authenticated ports at the firewall is
       essential for network perimeter security.
  •    Audit Logs with correct Clock synchronization shall help in investigations or as
       evidence in legal or disciplinary cases.
  •    Control of 12.4.4 – Control of Clock Synchronization remains the same for
       Standard 27018.
  •    NTP shall be synchronized as per the global standard.
