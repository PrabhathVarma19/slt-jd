  4.2 Password Creation
       • All user-level and system-level passwords must confirm to the Password
         Construction Requirements given in section 4.1.
       • Users must not include Personal information such as name, phone number,
         social security number, Date of Birth or Addresses in passwords.
       • User accounts that have system-level privileges granted through group
         memberships or programs (E.g., Sudo) must have a unique password from
         all other accounts held by that user to access system-level privileges.


  4.3 Password Change


      All system-level passwords (E.g., root, NT admin, application administration
      accounts, etc.) must be dual controlled & changed at least once in 42 or fewer
      days but not “0”.

      All user-level passwords (E.g., Email, web, desktop computer, etc.) must be
      changed at least once in 42 or fewer days but not “0”.

      All password change procedures must include the following:

       • Authentication of the user prior to changing the password (acceptable forms
         of authentication include answering a series).
       • The new password must comply with password strength requirements
         associated with the data classification for the service in question.



  4.4 Password Protection
       • User is responsible for the security of user password(s), and accountable for
         any loss/compromise.
       • Passwords must not be shared with anyone and need to be treated as
         sensitive, Confidential Trianz information.
       • Any user suspecting that his/her password may have been compromised
         must change the password immediately and report the incident to
         is@trianz.com and copy to itservicedesk@trianz.com
       • Passwords must not be inserted into email messages, and other forms of
         electronic communication.

          assistants, secretaries, managers, co-workers while on vacation, and family
          members) over the phone, on questionnaires.
        • Users should not write passwords down and store them anywhere in your
          office, in paper, computer system or mobile devices (phone, tablet) without
          encryption.
        • Users should not use the "Remember Password" feature of applications (for
