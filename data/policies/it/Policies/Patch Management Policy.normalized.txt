- **Quarterly**: Perform server updates.
- **On-demand**: Deploy high/critical severity patches immediately based on security recommendations.

### Printers, Peripherals, Switches, Routers, Firewalls, and Storage
- **Quarterly**: Check for new firmware updates by referencing OEM portals, emails, security blogs, etc.
- **Vendor Update**: Upgrade firmware within a week of vendor notifications, referencing vendor notifications.

**5.1.1.2 Zero-day Vulnerabilities**

- **Immediate Risk Assessment**: The IS Security team will identify affected systems, assess the impact, and determine exposure.
- **Emergency Patch Deployment**: Vendor-released patches or hotfixes must be applied as soon as they become available.
- **Temporary Mitigations**: If no patch is available, implement workarounds such as:
  - Disabling affected services
  - Applying firewall rules
  - Restricting access
- **Expedited Testing**: Conduct rapid testing of patches in a controlled environment before deployment to prevent system disruptions.
- **Prioritized Deployment**: Patches should be applied to critical systems first, followed by non-critical assets.
- **Monitoring & Threat Intelligence**: Continuously monitor for new threats, indicators of compromise, and vendor updates.
- **Incident Response Integration**: Align patching efforts with the incident response process to contain, eradicate, and recover from potential exploitation.
- **Post-Patch Review**: Validate successful patch updates, conduct security testing, and update documentation for future reference.

**Exceptions**: Systems, network devices, security appliances, and applications that cannot be patched to resolve known vulnerabilities must have justification documented by the device/application owner, and necessary compensating controls must be implemented.

**Systems**

- All systems (desktops and laptops) must have automatic updates enabled for security patches for the operating system.
- All endpoints will be patched for critical third-party applications or new version upgrades based on security recommendations.
