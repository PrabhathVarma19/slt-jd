- Data networks
- LAN servers
- Personal computers (stand-alone or network-enabled) located at Trianz offices and company production-related locations
- Any personal computers, laptops, mobile devices, and servers authorized to access Trianz’s data networks

No employee is exempt from this policy.

## 3. Policy

### 3.1 Physical Security Perimeter
The physical layout of Trianz’s information processing facilities will be segregated into perimeter zones, each with varying levels of access restrictions and authorization requirements:
- **Public Zone and Reception Zone**: Limited restrictions; area under overall surveillance.
- **Office Zone**: Limited access; registration with reception required; area under overall surveillance.
- **Restricted Access Zone**: Limited access; access logged; escorted access for visitors; area under surveillance (e.g., secure bays).
- **Highly Restricted Access Zone**: Specifically authorized personnel only; highly restricted access; logged access; specific authorization required for employee and visitor access; area under surveillance (e.g., server room).

### 3.2 Physical Entry Access
- All employees, contractors, consultants, and visitors entering Trianz premises must carry Trianz approved identification badges.
- Physical access to Trianz information systems facilities is restricted to authorized persons only. Authorization is granted only for business or technical reasons.
- All access logs must be retained for a minimum of three years.
- Secure areas (restricted zones) must be protected with a combination of access control devices (e.g., physical barriers, intrusion alarms) and access-logging equipment (e.g., card key systems, security cameras).

### 3.3 Visitor Management System
- Visitors must have supervised and controlled access to secure areas.
- Visitors are required to:
  - Sign in to a Visitors Log, which must be retained and reviewed. The log should include:
    - Visitor’s name
    - Company
    - Purpose of visit
    - Time of entrance
    - Time of departure
    - Date
  - Wear a visitor badge to indicate that a non-associate is present. Visitors must present picture identification to obtain the badge. Those without badges should be challenged for identification.
  - Be escorted by Trianz personnel or an individual with a current Trianz company badge while in the building.
- Visitors must declare their belongings (e.g., laptop computers, mobile phones) before entering restricted premises. Security must verify these declarations to prevent the removal of Trianz property from the building.

### 3.4 CCTV
- Surveillance cameras shall be installed and monitoring performed in areas perceived as high risk, unless otherwise required.

### 3.5 Securing Offices, Telecommunications Closets, Data Center and Facilities
- Data centers, equipment rooms, and telecommunications closets must be protected from unauthorized or unnecessary access.
- All data centers, equipment rooms, and telecommunications closets must be locked when unattended.
- Network devices (e.g., routers, switches, hubs) must be placed in restricted access zones to protect against unauthorized access.
- All source media for operating system software, applications, backup tapes/devices, and license keys must be clearly labeled and stored in a software library within a restricted access zone, accessible only to authorized personnel.
- Adequate intrusion detection controls (e.g., burglar alarms, motion detectors) and safety devices (e.g., fire alarms, smoke detectors, closed-circuit televisions) must be installed in all office locations, switch rooms, and data centers. Data centers must also have appropriate air conditioning and very early smoke detection systems.
- Support functions and equipment (e.g., photocopiers, fax machines) should be protected from unauthorized access.
- No combustible or hazardous materials are allowed in restricted zones.

### 3.6 Power Supplies
- Equipment must be protected from power failures and electrical anomalies.
- Electrical supply must conform to the manufacturer’s specifications for each piece of equipment.
- Critical equipment must be supported by an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). Backup power generating equipment should be in place where possible.
- Power supply backup equipment (including UPSs and backup generators) must undergo regular maintenance and testing.

### 3.7 Equipment Maintenance
- Equipment must be maintained according to manufacturers' recommendations to ensure availability and integrity.
- All faults (or suspected faults) must be logged in the current Incident Management System.
- All changes must be logged in the current Change Management System.

### 3.8 Wireless Access Points
- Wireless access points should be installed at a high level to reduce exposure and enhance security against theft or tampering.

### 3.9 Clear Desk and Clear Screen Policy
- Clear desk and clear screen guidelines must be written and implemented at each Trianz office location, including:
  - Paper and computer media must be stored in suitable locked cabinets, offices, or other secure furniture when not in use, especially outside working hours.
  - Sensitive or critical business information should be locked away (ideally in a fire-resistant safe or cabinet) when not required, particularly when the office is unattended.

### 3.10 Protection against Environmental Factors
- IT management must implement and maintain sufficient measures to protect against environmental factors such as fire, dust, power issues, excessive heat, and humidity. Refer to the BCP policy for details.

- The Information Security and Internal Audit Team will conduct periodic audits to ensure compliance with the policy and procedures without prior notice.
