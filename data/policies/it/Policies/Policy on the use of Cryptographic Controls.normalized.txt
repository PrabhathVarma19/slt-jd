## 1. Purpose
- The purpose of the cryptographic controls policy is to:
  - Ensure that confidential information is only received, transmitted, and stored in an encrypted form.
  - Ensure compliance with statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements.
  - Allow authorized employees to access relevant information held in encrypted form when needed.

## 2. Scope
- This policy applies to:
  - All Trianz employees, contractors, Cloud Service Providers, Cloud Service Customers, and other stakeholders responsible for understanding and complying with this policy.
- The requirements of this policy shall be implemented in all systems owned by Trianz, whether on-premises or in the cloud, and for all other Trianz-managed systems, wherever applicable.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities
1. **Cryptographic Controls**
   - **Role:** Cloud Service Provider
   - **Responsibility:** Provide information on the cryptography used for PII processing to the Cloud Service Customer and assist in applying cryptographic controls.

2. **Cryptographic Controls**
   - **Role:** IS Team/Cloud Service Customer
   - **Responsibility:** 
     - Ensure that cryptographic controls are justified by risk analysis.
     - Verify that cryptographic controls offered by the Cloud Service Provider:
       - Meet the cryptography policy.
       - Are compatible with other cryptographic protections.
       - Apply to data at rest, in transit, and in use within the Cloud Service.
       - Include Certification Authority (CA) details.

## 4. Policy
- The confidentiality of information imported or transferred on portable media or across networks will be protected using appropriate techniques such as:
  - Encryption
  - Data masking
  - Pseudonymization
  - Anonymization

- Encryption will be used whenever appropriate on all remote access connections to Trianz’s network and resources.

### Protection for Data in Transit
- Encryption controls shall be used when transferring confidential data over an external network to protect the confidentiality of sensitive information.

### Remote Access to the Trianz Network
- Systems providing access to the Trianz network from the Internet to business applications and confidential information must implement robust authentication methods, including:
  - Passwords
  - Encryption

- The design and installation of such systems, such as the Trianz Virtual Private Network (VPN), must be authorized by IT to ensure they do not provide unauthorized access to Trianz information.

### 4. Data Storage / Data at Rest
- Data that is stored or archived must be protected based on its classification. Ideally, data should be encrypted; however, other access controls may be sufficient depending on the sensitivity of the data.

### 5. Data in Processing
- Data must be protected using encryption while systems are processing the data, as applicable.

### 6. Key Management
When implementing data masking techniques, consider the following:
1. Do not grant all users access to all data.
2. Use obfuscated data in certain cases.
3. Comply with any legal or regulatory requirements.

When using data masking, pseudonymization, or anonymization, consider the following:
1. The strength of data masking, pseudonymization, or anonymization should match the usage of the processed data.
2. Implement access controls to the processed data.
3. Establish agreements or restrictions on the usage of the processed data.
4. Prohibit collating the processed data with other information to identify the PII principal.
5. Keep track of providing and receiving the processed data.

- All encryption keys must be securely stored, and access to the keys should be strictly restricted as defined by the access control policy.
- All encryption keys must be changed periodically according to their usage requirements for protecting systems and information.
- Trianz may use RSA secure ID tokens based on two-factor authentication for accessing client applications, as required by the client.
- Users are personally responsible for the secure use and protection of their private keys.
- The IS team shall act as the custodian of the RSA tokens.
- Trianz shall follow best practices for encryption.

### 7. Reference
- Guidelines for Information Labeling and Handling
- ISO 27001:2022

### 8. Exception(s)
- There are currently no exceptions. Any exceptions to the Cryptographic Controls policy shall follow the Exception Handling policy.

### 9. ISO Control Mapping(s)
- **Category of Control:** Technological Controls
  - **ISO 27001:2022 Control:** 8.24 Use of cryptography
  - **Document Name as per ISO 27001:2022:** Policy on the use of Cryptographic Controls
  - Control rules for the effective use of cryptography, including cryptographic key management, shall be defined and implemented.
