4. Policy
  The confidentiality of information being imported or transferred on portable media or
  across networks will be protected by use of appropriate techniques such as
  encryption, data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization.. Encryption will be
  used whenever appropriate on all remote access connections to the Trianz’s network
  and resources

  Protection for data in transit

  Encryption controls shall be used while transferring of confidential data over an
  external network to protect confidentiality of the sensitive information.

  Remote access to the Trianz network:

  Systems that provide access to the Trianz network from the Internet to business
  applications and Confidential Information must implement robust authentication
  methods, including passwords and encryption, to control access to information or
  systems

  The design and installation of such systems, such as the Trianz Virtual Private
  Network (VPN), shall be authorized by IT to ensure that they do not provide a route for
  unauthorized access to Trianz information assets.

Data Storage /Data at Rest:

Data while stored/archived shall be protected appropriately based on the
classification. Ideally data should be encrypted but depending on the sensitivity of
data, other access controls might suffice Data in Processing:

          •    Data must be protected using encryption while systems are

               processing the data, as applicable Key Management:

The following should be considered when implementing data masking

techniques:

          1. not granting all users access to all data.

          2. Use of obfuscated data in certain cases.

          3. any legal or regulatory requirements

The following should be considered when using data masking, seudonymization

or anonymization:

          1.   level of strength of data masking, pseudonymization or

               anonymization according to the usage of the processed data;

          2. access controls to the processed data;

          3. agreements or restrictions on usage of the processed data;

          4. prohibiting collating the processed data with other information in

               order to identify the       PII principal;

          5. keeping track of providing and receiving the processed data

          •    All the encryptions keys must be securely stored and access to the key
               should be strictly restricted as defined by the access control policy.
          •    All the encryption keys must be changed periodically as per the
               requirements of their use in protecting the systems and information.
          •    Trianz may use RSA secure ID tokens based on two factor authentication
               for accessing client applications, as required by client.

            •    IS team shall be custodian of the RSA tokens.
            •    Trianz shall follow best practices for Encryption.
