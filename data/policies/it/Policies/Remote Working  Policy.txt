1. Purpose
 The purpose of this policy is to ensure that Remote working is undertaken
 safely from an information security perspective. It is therefore required that
 information security risks, related to each specific Remote working
 scheme, are identified assessed and managed.


2. Scope
 • Trianz employees authorized for Remote working, having
   remote access to Trianz IT Infrastructure and Information
   systems wherever is applicable.
 • Trianz IT Infrastructure and Information systems to which remote access
  is permitted for business purpose.


3. Policy Statements

 3.1 Applicability
      This standard applies to remote access users who have access to
      Trianz IT infrastructure and information assets through public
      networks. In addition to remote working users, this standard is
      applicable to security, system, and network engineers and
      administrators, as well as computer security program managers,
      who are responsible for the technical aspects of preparing,
      operating, and securing remote access solutions and client
      Networks.


 3.2 Management Requirements
     Before reporting managers and/or supervisors authorize work to be
     performed under a remote working arrangement, they must do the
     following:

             • Identify the type of work to be performed through the remote working
                arrangement.
             • Only authorize Remote working user access to resources
                which are necessary to carry out the remote working
                arrangement safely and securely. Reporting Managers


  TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                 4
             and/or supervisors shall consider whether the needs to
             support the remote working arrangement can be met with
             less access and connectivity than provided at the Trianz
             office.
           • Work to be performed during an on demand / emergency
             situation to maintain essential operations may not warrant
             the remote working user to have the same access or
             connectivity as they do at the Trianz office. In many cases, a
             VOIP, MS –Lync, telephone and email access through a
             secure connection may be all that is required.

                  local security policies, etc

            • Security Update Requirements:
