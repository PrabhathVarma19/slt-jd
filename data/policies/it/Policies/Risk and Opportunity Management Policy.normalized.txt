  - **Mitigation**: Proactively change the plan to minimize the probability of occurrence, while accepting that residual risk remains.

- Residual risks must be verified to ensure they are at acceptable levels of risk magnitude (≤ 9).

- Contingency plans shall be applied for risks that have already occurred.

#### 4.2 Risk Monitoring
