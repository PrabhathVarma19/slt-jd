## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish a process to define security requirements for the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for all projects and products across Trianz.

## 2. Objective
The objective of the Secure SDLC Policy is to:
- Facilitate efficient implementation of security controls throughout the Development Life Cycle for Trianz managed applications.

## 3. Scope
The successful implementation of the Secure SDLC Policy requires a consistent and systematic approach to Secure SDLC across Trianz’s projects and products. The scope of the policy is as follows:
- Secure SDLC shall be applicable to all Implementation, Support, and Testing projects under the applicable Cloud, Analytics, Digitization, Infrastructure Practices, and Trianz products and services.
- This policy applies to all existing and new software developed by Trianz Delivery Teams for internal, external, or Client Managed Systems.

## 4. Policy Statements
Information Security & Data Privacy will be applicable at all stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (i.e., Requirements, Design, Coding, Validation, Release and Response, Maintenance, and Decommission). This policy aims to be language and platform independent, applicable across all software.

During all phases of the SDLC where a system is not in production, the following conditions must be met:
- The system must not have live data sets that contain information identifying actual people or corporate entities.
- The system must not contain actual financial data such as account numbers, security codes, or routing information.
- Sensitive information must never be used outside of production environments.

Ensure Security Metrics applicability for improvement of performance at each stage. For each phase of the Development Life Cycle, the Trianz Secure SDLC Policy shall ensure the following:

### 4.1 Requirement Phase:
- Ensure conformance with all appropriate security, privacy, and compliance requirements by using techniques such as Security Risk Analysis, Threat Modeling, and Use Cases/Abuse Cases.
- Ensure adherence to the CIA triad and policies for authentication, authorization, and accountability.
- Ensure all members of the development community undergo Secure SDLC training (Online or Classroom).
- All applications handling, processing, or storing critical, personal, or sensitive data shall follow applicable Data Privacy Guidelines.

### 4.2 Design Phase:
- Threat modeling shall be conducted to identify potential vulnerabilities, high-risk interfaces, and countermeasures.
- Planning must ensure that security and privacy requirements and goals are met.
- Test scenarios shall be designed based on cases and abuse cases.
- Sensitive information must be protected throughout its life cycle.
- Security architecture design principles shall be included, following guidelines on secure system engineering principles (e.g., web, applications, user interfaces, programmatic interfaces, file import/export, reports, and databases).
- Access to source code and other critical system resources during development, testing, or production shall be limited to authorized personnel as per the Access Control Policy.
- A periodic secure architecture review shall be conducted according to design principles, following guidelines on secure system engineering principles.

### 4.3 Development Phase:
- Secure coding guidelines shall be followed during coding.
- Security code reviews shall be conducted for every code check-in/build.
- Code reviews may be manual or automated using technologies such as static application security testing (SAST) and software composition analysis (SCA) tools for open-source components.
- Defensive programming techniques shall be applied where applicable, with controls and remediation against the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and CWE/SANS Top 25 programming errors as per technologies.
- Secure coding practices specific to the programming languages and techniques shall be utilized.

### 4.4 Validation Phase:
- DAST, SAST, SCA for monitoring third-party libraries, penetration testing, vulnerability testing, and compliance checks shall be performed during the validation phase.
- Backend network security controls such as DMZ, network firewall, WAF, and IDS/IPS must be implemented and reviewed.
- Security findings shall be remediated and managed, ensuring no open critical, high, or medium vulnerabilities in SAST, DAST, and VAPT.
- As part of BCP and DRP, all backup and restore mechanisms must be in place.
- Testing shall be conducted during and after development, with static application security testing (SAST) processes identifying security vulnerabilities in software.

### 4.5 Release and Response:
- Secure deployment and separation of duties shall be practiced.
- Application code for applications must be reviewed and approved by the Project/Product/Application Architect prior to deployment.

### 4.6 Maintenance Phase:
- Change management shall be included.
- A risk assessment must be performed when the system is modified.
- All significant changes in application code shall be reviewed for vulnerabilities prior to deployment.
- Software shall require regular maintenance and updates to keep up with changes in common technology, integrations with new tools, and emerging vulnerabilities.
- Code reviews shall be conducted whenever the code is modified or changed.
- Periodic vulnerability assessments shall be performed on production/application support systems, with appropriate measures taken to address risks associated with identified vulnerabilities.
- Source code must be protected against unauthorized access and tampering, for example, by using configuration management tools that provide features such as access control and version control.

### 4.7 Decommission Phase:
- Data shall be removed securely when the system is retired, in accordance with the data retention policy.

### 5. Roles and Responsibilities:
- **Internal Apps Team**: Responsible for conducting necessary scans and providing reports (Internal).
- **Project Manager**: Responsible for defining the strategy for appropriate security standards of all software applications handling sensitive information accessible from the organization, as well as monitoring, establishing, and enforcing these standards (Internal).
