The purpose of this policy is to provide security and compliance responsibilities shared between the Service Provider and the Customer when hosted in the Cloud, along with the supply chain partner’s management.

## 2. Objectives
The objective of the Shared Security Responsibility Model Policy is to facilitate effective implementation of security and controls for the different cloud service models.

## 3. Scope
This policy document covers the Shared Security Responsibility Model in the Cloud where Trianz acts as a Cloud Service Customer (CSC) or Cloud Service Provider (CSP) for the different Managed Cloud Service Models.

## 4. Policy Statement

### 4.1 Cloud Shared Responsibilities – Provider vs Customer
- **On-Prem**: The Customer is responsible for all aspects of the On-prem infrastructure in a hybrid cloud environment.
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: The Provider supplies infrastructure (servers and networking devices/services), while the Customer is responsible for installing software, provisioning virtual servers, containers, and controlling configurations.
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: The Provider offers a computing platform and technical stack, allowing the Customer to focus on building and managing applications (e.g., AWS Lambda).
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: The Provider delivers the entire infrastructure and application, with the Customer only needing to log in and use the application.
- **Identity**: Defines the user through identifiers such as user ID or employee number.
- **Authentication**: Verifies the user's identity based on enabled credentials.
- **Authorization**: Determines the access rights of a user.
- **Accountability**: Ensures actions performed by the user are traceable, enabling accountability.
- **Customer Content**: Includes data, text, images, audio, video, customer-developed software, configured machine images, and customer code. Customer account information managed by the Provider is not classified as Customer Content.

### 4.2 Responsibility

#### 4.2.1 Security & Compliance Accountability
- The Customer is ultimately accountable for security and compliance, even if responsibilities are delegated.

### 4.2.1 Cloud Service Model Responsibilities
- The customer must ensure that all shared security responsibilities throughout the supply chain, including those of the service provider, are documented, implemented, and managed.
- The customer is ultimately accountable for the security and compliance of the platform.

### 4.2.2 Data Classification & Management
- The customer is responsible for securely identifying, labeling, and correctly classifying data to meet compliance obligations across all Cloud Service Models.
- Providers must provide written contracts detailing how customer data security and privacy will be managed in the cloud.
- The provider's written commitments should include:
  - Security and privacy practices.
  - Limitations on customer data use.
  - Regulatory compliance adherence.
  - Evidence of certifications and audit reports available on demand by the customer.
- The customer should periodically verify that the cloud provider adheres to the above controls and should consider switching providers if data protection needs cannot be met.

**Service Model Responsibilities:**
- **IaaS Service Model:** 
  - Provider capabilities are limited to enabling the customer's virtual environment to accommodate data classification capabilities.
  - The customer is responsible for configuring and protecting stored data and ensuring data classification is enabled at all solution layers.
  
- **PaaS Service Model:** 
  - Provider capabilities are limited to enabling the customer's virtual environment and application for data classification.
  - The provider's responsibility is limited to authentication; the customer must configure and manage authorization for user data access.
  
- **SaaS Service Model:** 
  - The provider must enable data protection, user authentication, and user authorization.
  - The customer is responsible for configuring data authorization based on defined roles.

### 4.2.3 Client & End-point Protection
- The provider is responsible for enabling end-point protection for cloud services across all service models.
- The customer must ensure the security of devices used to connect to cloud services.
- The customer must ensure that all cloud-connecting endpoint devices are:
  - Hardened
  - Patched
  - Encrypted
  - Secured with mobile management solutions that provide remote wipe capabilities in case of theft.
- The provider must facilitate mobile management capabilities for customer endpoint devices, which must be configured appropriately by the customer in the SaaS model.

### 4.2.4 Identity & Access Management
- Identity & Access Management (IAM) enables the implementation of IAAA principles (Identity, Authentication, Authorization, Accountability) on the cloud platform.

**Service Model Responsibilities:**
- **IaaS Service Model:** 
  - The provider delivers IAM capabilities; the customer must configure and manage IAM controls.
  
- **PaaS & SaaS Service Models:** 
  - IAM controls are a shared responsibility between the customer and provider.
  - Considerations include:
    - Identity provider and services configuration.
    - User roles and identities configuration.
    - Access control configuration for effective solutions.
- The customer must assess additional security considerations such as:
  - Just in Time (JIT) administrative access.
  - Multi-Factor Authentication.
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) capabilities (own or third-party applications) and their effectiveness with the provider before implementation.

### 4.2.5 Application-Level Controls
- Application-level controls are necessary to secure the application layer from security breaches.

**Service Model Responsibilities:**
- **IaaS Service Model:** 
  - The customer is responsible for protecting the application layer deployed on virtual machines/containers from attacks, breaches, or compromises.
  - The customer must deploy skilled administrators to manage and secure the application and underlying hosts.
  
- **PaaS Service Model:** 
  - Application controls are a shared responsibility between the customer and provider.

### 4.2.6 Network Control
- Network control secures and configures the inter/intra connectivity of the platform.
- The network elements to be secured include, but are not limited to:
  - Virtual Machines
  - Containers
  - Pods
  - Virtual networks
  - Perimeter devices
  - Gateways
  - Proxies
  - Load balancers
  - DNS solutions
- **IaaS Service Model**: 
  - The Provider is responsible for the network security of the underlying infrastructure across regions and availability zones.
  - The Customer is responsible for the network security of the devices and services deployed in the infrastructure instances managed by them.
- **PaaS & SaaS Service Model**: 
  - Network security control is abstracted from the customers and provided as part of the service by the Provider, who holds responsibility for network security control.

### 4.2.7 Host Infrastructure
- Host infrastructure security controls include protecting, managing, and securing compute, storage, and platform services.
- Key controls for host infrastructure are:
  - OS configuration
  - Hardening
  - Patching
  - Access control management
  - Identity control configurations
- **IaaS Service Model**: 
  - Host infrastructure security is a shared responsibility between the Customer and the Provider.
