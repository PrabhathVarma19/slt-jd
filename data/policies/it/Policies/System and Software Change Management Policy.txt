1. Purpose
  The purpose of this policy is to establish management direction and high-level
  objectives for change management and also to ensure controlling the changes to the
  organization, business processes, information processing facilities and systems that
  affect information security.

  Various controls are categorized to mitigate the risk as follows:

       • Information being corrupted and/or destroyed;

       • Computer performance being disrupted and/or degraded;

       • Productivity losses being incurred; and

       • Exposure to reputational risk

       • Any changes that are being done in cloud service are not affecting the cloud
         services.


2. Scope
  This policy applies to all parties operating within the Trianz’s network environment
  or utilizing Information Resources, Cloud service provisioning and Cloud service
  consumption. It covers the data networks, LAN servers and personal computers
  (stand- alone or network-enabled), located at Trianz offices and company
  production related locations, where these systems are under the jurisdiction
  and/or ownership of Trianz including cloud environment, and any personal
  computers, laptops, mobile device and or servers authorized to access the Trianz’s
  data networks and Cloud Networks. None of the employees is exempted from this
  policy.


3. Policy
  Changes to information resources shall be managed and executed according to a
  formal change control process. The control process shall ensure that the changes
  proposed are reviewed, authorized, tested, implemented, and released in a
  controlled manner; and that the status of each proposed change is monitored.

5. Operational Requirements

 5.1 Change Documentation
    All change requests shall be logged whether approved or rejected on a
    standardized and central system. The approval of all change requests
    and the results thereof shall be documented. A documented audit trail,
    maintained at a Business Unit Level, containing relevant information shall
    be maintained at all times. This should include change request
    documentation, change authorization and the outcome of the change.
    No single person should be able to effect changes to production
    information systems without the approval of other authorized personnel.
    All the change items shall be included in either MSA or SLA.


 5.2 Change Classification
    All change requests shall be prioritized in terms of benefits, urgency,
    effort required and potential impact on operations.


 5.3 Change Testing
    Changes shall be tested in an isolated, controlled, and representative
    environment (where such an environment is feasible) prior to
    implementation to minimize the effect on the relevant business process,
    to assess its impact on operations and security and to verify that only
    intended and approved changes were made.


 5.4 Changes affecting SLA’s
    The impact of change on existing SLA’s shall be considered. Where
    applicable, changes to the SLA shall be controlled through a formal
    change process which includes contractual amendments.




   TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                 6
5.5 Approval
   All changes shall be approved prior to implementation. Approval of
   changes shall be based on formal acceptance criteria i.e. the change
   request was done by an authorized user, the impact assessment was
   performed and proposed changes were tested. All major changes shall
   be informed to information security and data privacy assurance team
   and seek approvals if necessary.


5.6 Communicating changes
   All users, significantly affected by a change, shall be notified of the
   change. The user representative shall sign-off on the change. Users
   shall be required to make submissions and comment prior to the
   acceptance of the change.


5.7 Change Implementation
   Implementation shall only be undertaken after appropriate testing
   and approval by stakeholders. All major changes shall be treated as
   new system implementation and shall be established as a project.
   Major changes will be classified according to effort required to
   develop and implement said changes.


5.8 Roll-Back Procedure
   Procedures for aborting and recovering from unsuccessful changes
   shall be documented. Should the outcome of a change be different to
   the expected result (as identified in the testing of the change),
   procedures and responsibilities shall be noted for the recovery and
   continuity of the affected areas. (Added for clarification)


5.9 Emergency Changes
   Specific procedures to ensure the proper control, authorization, and
   documentation of emergency changes shall be in place. Specific
   parameters will be defined as a standard for classifying changes as
   Emergency changes.

  5.10 Verification of Changes
       All changes shall be verified during and after implementation. On
       unsuccessful implementation, fall back procedures will be in place to
       ensure systems can revert back to what they were prior to
       implementation of changes, as the case may be.


  5.11 Communication of Changes
       All changes are communicated to all stakeholders that information
       security requirements have been met.


6. Monitoring
  Reporting metrics, documentation templates and change implementation
  reports are described in the approved and published Trianz Change
  Management Procedure. Change implementation reports should be
  generated and maintained by the IT team, which will be used to summarize
  the outcome of the changes implemented. These reports shall be made
  available to Information Security and Internal Audit upon request.


7. Compliance
 Any person, subject to this policy, who fails to comply with the provisions as
 set out above or any amendment thereto, shall be subjected to
 appropriate disciplinary or legal action in accordance with the Trianz
 Disciplinary Code and Procedures. Company Information Security policies,
 standards, procedures and guidelines shall comply with legal, regulatory
  and statutory requirements.

 All changes shall adhere to the policy to ensure the reliability of the systems
  and applications.


8. Exceptions(s)
 Exceptions to the System and Software change management policy shall follow the
  Exception handling policy.
