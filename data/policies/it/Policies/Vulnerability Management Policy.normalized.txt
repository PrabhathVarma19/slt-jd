### 1. Vulnerability Scanning and Assessment

1.1 **Credentialed Vulnerability Scans**
- Perform credentialed vulnerability scans, including endpoints (desktops and laptops) where technically feasible.

1.2 **Automated Vulnerability Scans**
- Conduct automated vulnerability scans at least quarterly on both internal and external networks.

1.3 **PCI-Specific Vulnerability Scans**
- For PCI-specific environments, perform vulnerability scans on externally facing IP addresses using an Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) and track findings through remediation.

1.4 **Ad Hoc Vulnerability Assessments**
- Perform ad hoc vulnerability assessments after any significant change to the PCI environment, such as:
  - New system component installations
  - Changes in network topology
  - Firewall rule modifications
  - Major version upgrades

1.5 **Pre-Upgrade Vulnerability Scanning**
- Conduct vulnerability scanning before any significant infrastructure or application upgrade or modification is implemented into production.

1.6 **Manual Vulnerability Assessments**
- Perform manual vulnerability assessments periodically to identify difficult-to-detect vulnerabilities.

1.7 **Unauthorized Wireless Access Point Testing**
- Test for unauthorized wireless access points on Commonwealth networks quarterly.

1.8 **Public-Facing Web Application Reviews**
- Review public-facing web applications using manual or automated application vulnerability security assessment tools or methods at least quarterly.

1.9 **PCI-Specific Web Application Reviews**
- For PCI-specific environments, review public-facing web applications after any change to the PCI environment or install a web application firewall in front of a public-facing web application as a mitigating control.

1.10 **Penetration Testing**
- Conduct internal and third-party network-layer and application-layer penetration testing at least annually, or collect evidence that a third party has performed a vulnerability assessment.

1.11 **Vulnerability Information Review**
- Perform timely reviews of vulnerability information from internal and external sources (e.g., software suppliers) and report to the Trianz Chief Assurance Office. The report must include:
  - Vulnerability description
  - Hosts affected
  - Current status at the time of reporting
  - Recommendations for remediation
  - Supporting information

### 2. Vulnerability Prioritization and Remediation

2.1 **Risk-Based Vulnerability Prioritization**
- Vulnerabilities shall be prioritized using a risk-based approach based on severity levels:

  - **Critical**: 
    - Threat actor may gain control of the host or there may be potential leakage of confidential information.
    - Remediation timeframe: 1 day.
  
  - **High**: 
    - Threat actor may gain access to sensitive information stored on the host, including security settings, resulting in potential misuse.
    - Remediation timeframe: 3 days.
  
  - **Medium**: 
    - Threat actor may collect sensitive information from the host, such as the precise version of software installed.
    - Remediation timeframe: 7 days.
  
  - **Low**: 
    - Limited risk to the host.
    - Remediation timeframe: 14 days.

2.2 **Minimizing Threat Likelihood and Impact**
- Perform necessary actions to minimize the likelihood and impact of threats that can exploit vulnerabilities by implementing security controls within established timeframes.

2.3 **Vulnerability Remediation**
- Remediate vulnerabilities by deploying patches or making configuration changes as a mitigation strategy, ensuring appropriate testing is conducted prior to patch deployment.

2.4 **Mitigation Strategy Approval**
- If a patch or mitigation strategy is not available, enact a mitigating control or obtain approval for a security deviation from the CIO/CISO.

2.5 **Vulnerability and Patch Management Reporting**
- Report through various stages of the vulnerability and patch management process using established performance metrics. Summary reports shall inform management of the current status and effectiveness of the vulnerability and patch management program.

2.6 **Monthly Vulnerability Reporting**
- IS Operations must report vulnerabilities monthly to the CIO/CISO Office, including:
  - Vulnerabilities by severity and aging
  - Vulnerabilities with deviations in place
  - Open and closed vulnerabilities

### 4. Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing

- **Periodic Vulnerability Assessment**: Conduct periodic vulnerability assessments of information assets, network equipment, and applications. Address all identified gaps.

- **Quarterly Assessments**: Perform vulnerability assessments on a quarterly basis for the entire enterprise or as per client requirements. Repeat assessments until "clean results" are achieved.

- **Post-Change Assessments**: After any major change in the IT environment, conduct a vulnerability assessment and penetration testing. Penetration tests are to be conducted annually.

- **Penetration Testing Requirements**: 
  - Penetration tests must be performed by either a third-party organization specialized in security testing or by specialized internal resources.
  - The tests must cover:
    - The entire Trianz network perimeter and critical systems.
    - Testing from both inside and outside the network.
    - Validation of segmentation and scope-reduction controls.
    - Review of threats and vulnerabilities experienced in the last 12 months.
    - Retention of penetration testing results and remediation activities.

- **Wireless Network Scans**: Perform wireless network scans using a Wireless Analyzer on a quarterly basis.

- **System File Integrity Monitoring**: Implement system file integrity monitoring on all critical servers in the production environment and on servers storing cardholder information.

- **Function Owner Responsibilities**: All function owners must adhere to the timeline requirements for responding to notifications of relevant vulnerabilities.

### 5. Measurement and Review

- **Remediation Time Measurement**: Measure the mean time interval taken to remediate or patch vulnerabilities after identification by the Vulnerability Assessment (VA) tool.

- **Asset Scanning Ratio**: Measure the ratio of known assets (from the Asset Management solution) to those actually scanned, categorized by internal and external assets.

- **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk, considering factors such as CVSS, asset criticality, exploit availability, asset accessibility (Internet vs. Intranet), and asset owner.

- **Average Risk Exposure Calculation**: Calculate the average risk exposure based on the risk-based prioritization of vulnerabilities.

- **Patch Status Reporting**: Report the percentage of systems that are fully patched and have no high-severity vulnerabilities, categorized by asset groups.

- **Measurement Inputs**: Inputs for the above measurements are obtained from the Vulnerability Assessment tool. For more details, refer to the Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) procedure.

### 6. Compliance and Monitoring

- **User Access Rights**: Conduct periodic reviews of the entire user identity, provisioning, and access rights lifecycle. Report findings, analysis, and recommendations to senior management within the specified timeline.

- **Configuration Standards**: Perform periodic reviews of critical system resources to ensure applicable hardening. Report findings to senior management within the specified timeline.

- **Network Architecture Review**: Conduct periodic reviews of the entire Resolver security architecture to ensure a layered, defense-in-depth approach. Report findings, analysis, and recommendations to senior management within Resolver.
