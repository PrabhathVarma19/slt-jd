## 1. Introduction
Web filtering enables Trianz to monitor, manage, and regulate users' web activity. By allowing access to approved websites (green sites) and blocking malicious or non-compliant content, web filtering helps protect against cybersecurity threats, enforce corporate policies, and enhance overall network security. This ensures a secure and productive browsing environment while mitigating risks such as malware, phishing, and unauthorized data access.

## 2. Objectives
- Establish controls to ensure authorized network traffic and prevent unauthorized access to the Internet.
- Enhance Cybersecurity by preventing access to malicious websites that may contain malware, phishing attempts, or other cybersecurity threats.
- Ensure Compliance by enforcing regulatory, legal, and organizational policies through the restriction of unauthorized or non-compliant web content.
- Mitigate Insider Threats by monitoring and controlling employee web activity to identify and prevent potential security risks from within the organization.

## 3. Purpose
- Protect systems from malware compromise and prevent access to unauthorized web resources.
- Eliminate security risks such as malware infection that may arise from access to external websites with malicious content.

## 4. Policy
Trianz shall establish and implement necessary controls to prevent employees from accessing external websites that may contain viruses, phishing materials, or other types of illegal information.

## 5. Implementation Guidelines
Trianz shall ensure effective techniques to prevent access to dangerous external websites by blocking the IP addresses or domains of websites identified as dangerous. Some browsers and anti-malware tools enable Trianz to do this automatically with effective implementation.

### a) Web Filtering Practices
- **URL Categorization:**
  - Blacklists and Whitelists are compared against predefined lists of known malicious or safe websites.
  - Human reviewers assess URLs and assign them to appropriate categories based on their content.
  - Contextual Analysis of URLs categorizes them based on the context in which they are shared or accessed, such as within a specific application or communication channel.

- **Web Content Filtering:**
  - Maintain log details of each access attempt, including the user, time, URL, and action taken (allowed or blocked).
  - These logs can be used for auditing, compliance, and troubleshooting purposes.
