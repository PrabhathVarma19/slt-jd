2. Purpose
   The Wireless devices or networks used to access, store, process, or transmit
   Trianz’s information or access must be implemented in a secure manner. This
   document describes the Information Security requirements for maintaining
   up-to-date Security patches.



3. Objectives
   This policy applies to all wireless devices, networks, services, and technologies
   used to access, store, process or transmit Trianz’s information. The term
   “wireless” refers to any technology that does not use cables.

   Wireless includes radio frequency (i.e., satellite, microwave, radio) and optical
   (i.e. infrared) technologies.

   Wireless networks include both wireless local area networks (WLANs) and
   wireless wide area networks.

   Wireless devices are any end-user device that uses wireless technology to
   communicate.



4. Scope
   The scope of this Policy is to secure and protect Trianz’s Wi-Fi assets from
   wireless security threats.



TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                        4
5. Policy

  5.1 Access Control
       All wireless infrastructure devices that reside at Trianz’s network, or provide
       access shall:

         •   Use Industry Standards for Wireless Security
         •   Use Industry Standard authentication protocols and infrastructure
         •   Use industry Standard encryption protocols
         •   Maintain a hardware address (MAC address) that can be registered
             and tracked.


  5.2 Risk Assessment
      Trianz’s Security Team shall employ security measures commensurate with
      the risk associated with the wireless network.

      Due to the ever-changing threats and vulnerabilities, risk assessments shall
      be conducted on a periodic basis no less than annually to provide an
      accurate picture of the total risk to the organization.

      A risk assessment shall be performed to ensure the capabilities of
      protection for the technologies utilized.

      A risk assessment shall include but not limited to; identifying data sensitivity,
      network vulnerabilities, and critical services. The focus is to identify potential
      threats and vulnerabilities.


  5.3 Securing Wireless Networks and Devices:
       • Change default passwords.: Changing default passwords makes it
         harder for attackers to access a device. Use and periodic changing of
         complex passwords shall be your first line of defense in protecting your
         device

       • Restrict access: Only authorized users shall be allowed to access Wi-Fi
         network. Each piece of hardware connected to a network has a media
         access control (MAC) address. Restrict access Wi-fi network by filtering
         these MAC addresses.




TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                            5
       • Encrypt the data on your network: Encrypting Trianz’s wireless data
         prevents anyone who might be able to access network from viewing it. Wi-
         Fi Protected Access (WPA), WPA2, and WPA3 encrypt information being
         transmitted between wireless routers and wireless devices.

       • WPA3 is currently the strongest encryption. WPA and WPA2 are still
         available; however, it is advisable to use equipment that specifically
         supports WPA3, as using the other protocols could leave your network
         open to exploitation.

       • Protect Service Set Identifier (SSID): To prevent outsiders from easily
         accessing Trianz’s network, avoid publicizing your SSID, which makes it
         more difficult for attackers to find a network. At the very least, change your
         SSID to something unique. Leaving it as the manufacturer’s default could
         allow a potential attacker to identify the type of router and possibly exploit
         any known vulnerabilities.

       • Install a firewall: Consider installing a firewall directly on your wireless
         devices (a hostbased firewall), as well as on your home network (a router-
         or modem-based firewall). Attackers who can directly tap into your
         wireless network may be able to circumvent your network firewall—a host-
         based firewall will add a layer of protection to the data on your computer.

       • Maintain antivirus software: Install antivirus software and keep your virus
         definitions up to date. Many antivirus programs also have additional
         features that detect or protect against spyware and adware.

       • Keep your access point software patched and up to date: The
         manufacturer of wireless access point will periodically release updates to
         and patches for a device’s software and firmware. Be sure to check the
         manufacturer’s website regularly for any updates or patches for your
         device.

       • Check internet provider’s or router manufacturer’s wireless security
         options: Internet service provider and router manufacturer may provide
         information or resources to assist in securing your wireless network. Check
         the customer support area of their websites for specific suggestions or
         instructions. This shall be applicable for work from home users.

7. Monitoring and Reporting:
   Wireless strength: Monitor and manage factors like total number of access
   points, number of users, rogue access point signal strength.

   Wireless network traffic: Monitor the total bytes received by wireless client
   systems, total bytes received by access points and more

   Wireless network utilization: Monitor the various parameters that helps to
   keep a tab on the utilization of wireless networks such as CPU utilization,
   memory utilization, total bytes sent to the station, disk utilization, client total
   bytes transmitted etc.

   MIS Reports must generate based on monitoring factors and alert must be
   generated as and when modifications happen at the wireless networks.
