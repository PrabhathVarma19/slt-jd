- Identify secure areas and enforce secure access to them.

### 6.3 Information Flow Enforcement
- Ensure all Trianz managed systems enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems.

### 6.4 Segregation of Duties
- Segregate duties of individuals as necessary to prevent malicious activity without collusion.
- Implement segregation of duties through assigned information asset access authorizations.
- Ensure segregation of development, production, and testing environments based on the user’s roles.
- Document segregation of duties.

### 6.5 Least Privilege
- Ensure only authorized individuals are using all Trianz business systems and applications.
- Review the user access control matrix on a quarterly basis by approved stakeholders.

### 6.6 System Use Notification
- Ensure an approved system use notification message or banner is displayed before granting access to the system, providing privacy and security notices consistent with regulations, standards, and policies.
- Retain the notification message or banner on the screen until users take explicit actions to log on or further access the information asset.

### 6.7 Concurrent Session Control
- Limit the number of concurrent sessions for each system account to the minimum needed for information assets across all Trianz business systems.

### 6.8 Session Lock
- All Trianz managed systems shall prevent further access to the information asset by initiating a session lock after 300 seconds of inactivity.
- Retain the session lock until the user reestablishes access using established identification and authentication procedures.

### 6.9 Remote Access
- Ensure privileged users connect to servers, devices, applications, or similar privileged access management (PAM) consoles.
- Document allowed methods of remote access to the information assets through implemented SSL VPN.
