      and resources.
  •   Access control system provide quick, convenient access to those persons who
      are authorized, while at the same time, restricting access to unauthorized
      people.


2. Objectives
  •   The objective of this procedure is to establish controls to ensure authorized user
      access and prevent unauthorized access to Information systems


3. Scope
  •   This procedure is applicable to all Trianz Business systems, Trianz Products &

6. Process Description (Procedure)
  •   All Trianz managed systems must develop, adopt or adhere to a formal,
      documented access control procedure that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
      responsibilities,   management        commitment,       coordination      among
      organizational entities, and compliance.
