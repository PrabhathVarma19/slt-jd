### 6. Business Continuity and Plan Procedure

#### 6.1 Identifying and Prioritizing Critical Functions, Systems and Processes
- The business continuity representative from the InfoSec team is responsible for identifying and prioritizing Trianz's critical processes and applications, with assistance from delivery and corporate functions.
- The InfoSec BCM Representative assesses the impacts of losing information and services from both internal and external sources.

#### 6.2 Identifying Critical Resources
- The InfoSec BCM representative identifies resources critical to the information systems that support the functions, systems, and processes identified in the previous section.
- Critical resources must include everything necessary to support the critical function, system, or process. Examples of critical resources include:
  - Servers, workstations, and peripherals
  - Applications and data
  - Media and output
  - Telecommunications connections
  - Physical infrastructure (e.g., electrical power, environmental controls)
  - Personnel

#### 6.3 Business Continuity Planning
- Business continuity planning involves maintaining business functions or quickly resuming them in the event of a major disruption.
- A business continuity plan outlines the procedures and instructions the organization must follow during disasters.
- For each critical process/system/ICT function, the following values are assigned:
  - Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for applications and products
  - Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for business processes, products, and applications
- The InfoSec BCM Representative prepares the Business Continuity Plan, which includes:
  - Business Continuity Strategies to reduce the impact of business disruptions
  - Business Requirements based on Disaster Classification
  - Key resources and contact details
  - An escalation plan listing contacts to be notified during a potential emergency or disaster
  - An organization chart for test planning, which includes:
    - **Level 1**: Invocation of the Business Continuity Process for the Primary Facility from within its premises
    - **Level 2**: Invocation of the Business Continuity Process for the Primary Facility from a different city in the same country

- The Business Recovery Group (BRG) along with the Crisis Management Team (CMT) activates the Disaster Recovery Procedure.
- The InfoSec BCM Representative identifies an alternate site to continue operations in case of failure to resume work.
- The InfoSec BCM Representative ensures that business activities return to normal operations.
- The InfoSec BCM Representative conducts call tree, tabletop, and simulation tests for key critical projects as per contractual agreements.
- Call tree tests are conducted bi-annually, while tabletop simulation tests are conducted annually, depending on client requirements.

**7. Planning Information Security Continuity**

- Trianz maintains a single framework of business continuity plans to ensure consistency in addressing information security requirements and identifying testing maintenance priorities.
- Each plan must have a specific owner responsible for emergency procedures, manual fallback plans, and resumption plans related to the appropriate business resources and processes.

The business continuity planning framework must address the following information security requirements:

a) **Activation Conditions**: Describe the process for activating the plans, including how to assess the situation and who is involved.

b) **Emergency Procedures**: Outline the actions to be taken following an incident.

c) **Temporary Operational Procedures**: Specify procedures to follow until recovery and restoration are complete.

d) **Resumption Procedures**: Detail the actions required to return to normal business operations.

e) **Critical Assets and Resources**: Identify the essential assets and resources needed to perform emergency, fallback, and resumption procedures.

- Responsibilities for executing components of the plan must be clearly assigned to nominated individuals.
