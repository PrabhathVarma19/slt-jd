6. Business Continuity and Plan Procedure

6.1 Identifying and Prioritizing Critical Functions, Systems and
    Processes
       • Business continuity representative from InfoSec team identifies and
         prioritizes the Trianz critical processes and Applications with the help
         of delivery and corporate functions.
       • InfoSec BCM Representative assesses impacts from loss of
         information and services from both internal and external sources.


6.2 Identifying Critical Resources
       • InfoSec BCM representative identifies the resources that are critical to
         the information systems that support the functions, systems and
         processes that has been identified in above section
       • The critical resources should include everything necessary to support
         the critical function, system, or process. Some examples of critical
         resources are:
          o Servers, workstations, and peripherals,
          o Applications and data,
          o Media and output,
          o Telecommunications connections,




TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                 6

            Personnel.


  6.3 Business Continuity Planning
       • Business continuity planning refers to maintaining business functions
         or quickly resuming them in the event of a major disruption.
       • A business continuity plan outlines procedures and instructions an
         organization must follow in the face of such disasters.
       • For each critical (in scope) process/system/ICT functions two values
         are assigned:
          o Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for Applications, products.
          o Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for business processes,
             products, and applications.
          o InfoSec BCM Representative prepares the Business Continuity
             Plan which contains the following sections:
          o Business Continuity Strategies to reduce impact of business
             disruptions.
          o Business Requirements based on Disaster Classification.
          o Key resources and contact details.
          o Escalation plan contains the list of contacts shall be notified
             during a potential emergency or disaster Communication
             Plan.
          o Organization Chart Test Planning shown below table:

                             •   Invocation of the Business Continuity Process for
              Level 1
                                 the Primary Facility from within its premises.

                                 the
              Level 2
                                 Primary Facility from a different city in the same
                                 country

       • BRG along with CMT activates the Disaster Recovery Procedure.

         contractual agreement.
       • Call tree tests shall be conducted bi-annually, and tabletop
         simulation tests shall be conducted annually depending on the client
         requirement.
       • In case of pandemic situation and associates will be working
         remotely, all the BCP tests (work area recovery simulations) for the
         key projects and functions will be on hold during that period.


7. Planning Information Security Continuity
   Trianz follows a single framework of business continuity plans that are
   maintained to ensure all plans are consistent, to consistently address
   information security requirements, and to identify priorities for testing
   maintenance.

   Each plan shall have a specific owner. Emergency procedure, manual fallback
   plans and resumption plans shall be within the responsibility of owners of
   appropriate business resources and process involved.

   A business continuity planning framework shall address the identified
   information security requirements by considering the following.

   a) The conditions for activating the plans which describe the process to be
      followed (e.g., how to access the situation, and who is too involved) before
      each plan is activated.

   b) Emergency procedures which describe the action to be taken following an
      incident.

   c) Temporary operational procedures to follow pending completion of recovery
      and restoration.

   d) Resumption procedures which describe the action to be taken to return to
      normal business operations.

   e) The critical assets and resources needed to be able to perform the
      emergency, fallback and resumption procedures.

   The responsibilities of the individuals, describing who is responsible for executing
   which components of the plan is alternative shall be nominated.
