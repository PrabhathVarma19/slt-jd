1. Introduction
  The Capacity Management is responsible for ensuring that the Capacity of the
  IT Infrastructure matches the evolving demands of the business in the most
  cost-effective and timely manner. Capacity Management is essentially a
  balancing act; balancing:


        •    Cost against Capacity – i.e. the need to ensure that processing Capacity
             that is purchased is not only cost justifiable in terms of business need, but
             also the need to make the most efficient use of those resources, and
        •    Supply against demand – i.e. making sure that the available supply of
             processing power matches the demands made on it by the business, both
             now and in the future; it may also be necessary to manage or influence
             the demand for a particular resource.


  8.1       Objective(s)
            The objective of Capacity Management is to understand the business
            requirements, the organization’s operations, and the IT Infrastructure, to
            ensure that all the current and future Capacity and performance aspects
            of the business requirements are provided cost-effectively.

4. Process Description

  8.1 Capacity Management process flow steps

      4.1.1   Manage business capacity requirements
                  Based on the business plan/SOW, PM/project team identifies the
                  resource capacity needed to meet the present and future business
                  requirements. This includes-Human, Technical-HW/SW,
                  Information/data. PM/project team quantifies the business impact
                  for new or changed services.



      4.1.2 Identify and agree SLAs
                  PM/ project team identifies SLAs for all critical utilities, service
                  components and services and monitors SLA compliance on periodic
                  basis.



      4.1.3 Prepare and maintain capacity plan
                  PM/project team prepares high level capacity plan considering the
                  business scenario and the allocated budget article. PM reviews the
                  capacity plan once in 6 months for continued suitability and
                  identifies gaps if any. Refer PM-Work Book-Capacity and availability
                  tracker

        4.1.4 Monitor resource usage to balance supply and demand
                  PM/ Project team monitors capacity utilization. PM Assess capacity
                  management effectiveness and efficiency by use of trend analysis
                  for predicting the future capacity requirements and for fine tuning the
                  utilization.



        4.1.5 Review for corrective actions
                  PM/Project team plans corrective actions and improvements
                  wherever required and implements them for improving capacity
                  management effectiveness.
