1. Objectives


  To monitor the logging of events, association of each logged event with a
  particular user, provision or a mechanism to retrieve and report information on
  logged events and reporting on the effectiveness and compliance with standards
  including but not limited to ISO 27001: 2022 & ISO 27701: 2019



2. Scope
  This procedure applies to all Trianz users and operating units including the third
  parties, Cloud Providers, Cloud Customers and all Trianz Information System
  Resources including corporate data, as well as the application and systems
  software



3. Procedure

  3.1 Purpose of Monitoring


  •   To safeguard information and computing resources from various business

      and environmental threats, the activities related to the use of Trianz

      Information System Resources will be monitored.

  •   Ensure that the information on these systems is not disclosed to unauthorized

      individuals and that the integrity of the data is maintained.

  •   Monitoring is also done to ensure conformity to Logical Access Security Policy

      and related procedures, Back-up Methods etc.



  3.2 Audit Trail Rules




TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                        4
  •   Auditing must be enabled on all the Servers and Network Devices for recording

      exceptions and other security-related events.

  •   If possible, all audit records should be sent to central server for monitoring and
      correlation.
  •   All physical and logical access logs, audit trails etc. shall be retained for a
      minimum of five years.
  •   A record of successful system access, in addition to rejected attempts, should

      be created. At a minimum, audit trails must include the following: -

             ➢ User ID’s

             ➢ Date/time of the most recent attempt

             ➢ Dates and times for logon and logoff

             ➢ Terminal identity or location identifier

             ➢ IP address and source

             ➢ Computer name and source


  3.3 Monitoring of System Use
      •   The systems use must be monitored to ensure that users are performing
          processes that have been explicitly authorized.
      •   The level of monitoring required for individual systems should be
          determined by a separate risk assessment. Areas that must be monitored
          are:
      •   Access failures
      •   Allocation and use of accounts with a privileged access capability
      •   Tracking of selected transactions
      •   The use of sensitive resources
      •   IDS/IPS activity
      •   Firewall activity.
      •   O/S and application access attempts
      •   Cloud account access details
      •   Malware and ransomware detection alerts from AV


TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                      5
      •   Real-time alerts for publicly accessible systems (e.g. external web sites) for
          any suspicious user activity.
      •   Browser Weakness and Updates


  3.4 Logging: Control
     Logs that record activities, exceptions, faults, and other relevant events should
     be produced, stored, protected, and analyzed.


  3.5 Purpose
     To record events, generate evidence, ensure the integrity of log information,
     prevent against unauthorized access, identify information security events that
     can lead to an information security incident and to support investigations.
     Guidance The organization should determine the purpose for which logs are
     created, what data is collected and logged, and any log-specific requirements
     for protecting and handling the log data. This should be documented in a
     topic-specific policy on logging. Event logs should include for each event, as
     applicable:

          ➢ user IDs.
          ➢ system activities.
          ➢ dates, times and details of relevant events (e.g. log-on and log-off);
          ➢ device identity, system identifier and location.
          ➢ network addresses and protocols.

     The following events should be considered for logging:

          a) successful and rejected system access attempts.
          b) successful and rejected data and other resource access attempts.
          c) changes to system configuration.
          d) use of privileges.
          e) use of utility programs and applications.
          f) iles accessed and the type of access, including deletion of important
             data files.
          g) alarms raised by the access control system.
          h) activation and de-activation of security systems, such as anti-virus
             systems and intrusion detection systems.
          i) creation, modification, or deletion of identities;

TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                       6
         j)   transaction executed by users in applications. In some cases, the
              applications are a service or product provided or run by a third party.

     It is important for all systems to have synchronized time sources (see 8.11) as
     this allows for correlation of logs between systems for analysis, alerting and
     investigation of an incident.


  3.6 Protection of logs
        Users, including those with privileged access rights, should not have
        permission to delete or deactivate logs of their own activities. They can
        potentially manipulate the logs on information processing facilities
        under their direct control. Therefore, it is necessary to protect and
        review the logs to maintain accountability for the privileged users.

        Controls should aim to protect against unauthorized changes to log
        information and operational problems with the logging facility including:

          a) alterations to the message types that are recorded.

        IS/ISO/IEC

          b) log files being edited or deleted.

          c) failure to record events or over-writing of past recorded

              events if the storage media holding a log file is exceeded.

              For protection of logs, the use of the following techniques

              should be considered: cryptographic hashing, recording in

              an append-only and read-only file, recording in a public

              transparency file.

              Some audit logs can be required to be archived because of

              requirements on data retention or requirements to collect

              and retain evidence

       Where the organization needs to send system or application logs to a
       vendor to assist with debugging or troubleshooting errors, logs should be
       de-identified where possible using data masking techniques (see 8.11) for


TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                         7
       information such as usernames, internet protocol (IP) addresses, hostnames,
       or organization name, before sending to the vendor. Event logs can contain
       sensitive data and personally identifiable information. Appropriate privacy
       protection measures should be taken


  3.7 Log Analysis:
      Log analysis should cover the analysis and interpretation of information
      security events, to help identify unusual activity or anomalous behavior, which
      can represent indicators of compromise.

      Analysis of events should be performed by considering:

      a) the necessary skills for the experts performing the analysis.
      b) determining the procedure of log analysis.

      c) the required attributes of each security-related event.

      d) exceptions identified through the use of predetermined rules [e.g. security
           information and event management (SIEM) or firewall rules, and intrusion
           detection systems (IDSs) or malware signatures];

      e) known behavior patterns and standard network traffic compared to
           anomalous activity and behavior [user and entity behavior analytics
           (UEBA)].

      f)   results of trend or pattern analysis (e.g. because of using data analytics, big
           data techniques and specialized analysis tools).

      g) available threat intelligence.
      Log analysis should be supported by specific monitoring activities to help
      identify and analyze anomalous behavior, which includes:

  ➢ reviewing successful and unsuccessful attempts to access protected resources
    [e.g. domain name system (DNS) servers. web portals and file shares].

  ➢ checking DNS logs to identify outbound network connections to malicious
      servers, such as those associated with botnet command and control servers.

           o   examining usage reports from service providers (e.g. invoices or service
               reports) for unusual activity within systems and networks (e.g. by
               reviewing patterns of activity).


TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                        8
              o   including event logs of physical monitoring such as entrance and exit to
                  ensure more accurate detection and incident analysis.

      o   correlating logs to enable efficient and highly accurate analysis. Suspected and
          actual information security incidents should be identified (e.g. malware
          infection or probing of firewalls) and be subject to further investigation (e.g. as
          part of an information security incident management process, see 525), Other
          information System logs often contain a large volume of information, much of
          which is extraneous to information security monitoring.

          To help identify significant events for information security monitoring purposes,
          the use of suitable utility programs or audit tools to perform file interrogation
          can be considered. Event logging sets the foundation for automated monitoring
          systems (see 8.16) which can generate consolidated reports and alerts on
          system security.

          A SIEM tool or equivalent service can be used to store, correlate, normalize and
          analyze log information, and to generate alerts. SIEMs tend to require careful
          configuration to optimize their benefits. Configurations to consider include
          identification and selection of appropriate log sources, tuning and testing of
          rules and development of use cases.

          Public transparency files for the recording of logs are used, for example, in
          certificate transparency systems. Such files can provide an additional detection
          mechanism useful for guarding against log tampering.

          In cloud environments, log management responsibilities can be shared
          between the cloud service customer and the cloud service provider.
          Responsibilities vary depending on the type of cloud service being used.


3.8 Monitoring of Firewall Audit Reports


  •       The designated IS Administrator in IS Department will review the Internet
          connection audit reports created on the firewall for any unusual/suspicious
          activities.
  •       The period between reviews should not exceed a week. Alarms must be
          configured to alert the IS Administrator about any suspected activities, security



TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                           9
     breaches or violations and any other related events generated by the firewall.
     The events to be monitored include, but not limited to:
 •   A session being initiated from the external world
 •   Spoofing activities
 •   Suspicious activities taking place internally and from external sources
 •   Well known hacker signatures
 •   Password guessing attempts
 •   Attempts to use privileges that have not been authorized
 •   Modifications to production application software
 •   Modification to system software
 •   Beaconing behavior towards suspicious domains


 3.9Windows Environment
     Logging and reporting Details/Test:

      Windows comes with several monitoring and auditing tools, which enable
      powerful logging and auditing. In the absence of auditing and logging, it may
      not be possible to:

      Track the attacker in the event of a security breach

      Detect unauthorized access attempts to resources.

      Track the causes for errors or unauthorized changes (if any).

      Have control over changes to critical settings, like the Registry.

      Thus, detective controls become very weak in the absence of appropriate
      monitoring and auditing.

      It is recommended that the auditing and monitoring features of Windows be
      used effectively.

      Some of such events are:

      o Audit account logon events = Success, Failure


       o Audit account management = Success, Failure



TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                   10
       o Audit directory service access = Failure


       o Audit logon events = Success, Failure


       o Audit object access = Failure


      o Audit policy change = Success, Failure


      o Audit privilege use = Failure


       o Audit process tracking = No auditing


      o Audit system events = Success, Failure


       o UNIX environment


       o Logging and reporting


       o Details/Test:


      o The following system logs should be reviewed and have restricted


      access: /etc/wtmp - contains a history of system logins. (This file is not


      plain text and needs to be


      interpreted by a UNIX utility such as “who”.

      /usr/adm/sulog - Review the contents of this file, it logs the use of the su

      command. The su (super user) command can compromise security by

      accessing files belonging to other users without their knowledge.



TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                    11
      In order to access such files, the password of the file owner must be known. Use

      of this command shall evidence the inappropriate use of a password by other

      users.

      /usr/bin/uulog - contains a history of each use of uucp, uuto, and uux.

      /etc/security/failedlogin - Review the log to determine list of failed login.

      Enable logging for specific commands such as kill, killall, chown, chmod,

      shutdown and chgrp using TCB (if installed)

      In case of FTP services, FTP logs should also be maintained as this service is

               highly critical and sensitive from security aspects, therefore, it is

               recommended to monitor the FTP activities regularly.

      Note: The most important files to be reviewed are /usr/adm/syslog and

               /usr/adm/messages (or equivalent). Enabling only selected auditing

               features may have limited affect on the performance of the Application

               or Server.



      3.10 Oracle Environment
        Logging and reporting Details/Test:

           • Policies and procedures to review audit trails in a timely manner and

           developing an audit trail archiving strategy shall be adopted. This strategy

           shall address the following:

           • archive rotation period (the amount of time before an archive can be
           overwritten);
           • security of the audit trails - archive logs (confidentiality
           and integrity); and redundancy of the audit trails
           (disaster recovery planning)




TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                       12
        •   The enabling of auditing feature in a database shall be as per the business

            and operational requirements.

        •   The concerned Department shall first identify the relevant critical tables in

            a database which are

        •   required to be kept confidential from the organization’s perspective and

            then the auditing features can be enabled for those critical areas.

        •   Trianz would ensure that if logs of the User transactional level details at

            Application level are being captured, then the Auditing at Database Level

            can be restricted to key actions such as account logon, modification to

            system settings, etc.

        •   These activities can be identified after evaluating their impact on the

            business or operations and shall be monitored for a period to analyze the

            effect on the performance of the system.

             The following auditing features would be logged depending upon the
             requirements:-

                  ➢ Application Account Activity
                  ➢ Failed Attempts to Access Objects
                  ➢ Failed Attempts to Issue Sensitive Commands
                  ➢ Failed Connections
                  ➢ Failed Login Attempts
            Fire call Accounts: - 'Fire call' accounts have a very high, if not unlimited,

            level of privilege within a database. These accounts are only used for

            emergency purposes and should be secured accordingly.                 Actions

            performed by these accounts should be audited for identification of

            irregular and/or unauthorized use or as a reference as to what occurred

            when a 'Fire call' account was used in an emergency.



TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                        13
           If actions performed by 'Fire call' accounts are not audited, use of these

           accounts in an irregular or unauthorized manner could go unnoticed.

           Additionally, retracing the events that occurred during an emergency

           would not be possible.



  3.11 Cloud Environment


  •   Trianz would maintain the logs of Operations and Maintenance for necessary
      CAPA (Corrective action and Preventive Action)
  •   Also, would implement additional logging capabilities, if needed
  •   Ensures the Controlled Access to Log information (used for Monitoring and
      Operational Diagnostics) as it would contain the PII Information
