## 4. Procedure

### 4.1 Purpose of Monitoring
- Safeguard information and computing resources from business and environmental threats.
- Ensure information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals.
- Maintain the integrity of data.
- Ensure conformity to the Logical Access Security Policy and related procedures.

### 4.2 Audit Trail Rules
- Auditing must be enabled on all Servers and Network Devices to record exceptions and security-related events.
- All audit records should be sent to a central server for monitoring and correlation, if possible.
- The IT Department must maintain all audit records for at least one month and a maximum of one year.
- A record of successful system access and rejected attempts must be created.
- Audit trails must include:
  - User IDs
  - Dates and times for logon and logoff
  - Terminal identity or location

### 4.3 Monitoring of System Use
- System use must be monitored to ensure users perform explicitly authorized processes.
- The level of monitoring for individual systems should be determined by a separate risk assessment.
- Areas to be monitored include:
  - Access failures
  - Allocation and use of accounts with privileged access
  - Tracking of selected transactions
  - Use of sensitive resources
  - IDS/IPS activity
  - Firewall activity
  - Operating System and application access attempts
  - Real-time alerts for publicly accessible systems (e.g., external websites) for suspicious user activity.

### 4.4 Monitoring of Firewall Audit Reports
- The designated IT Administrator in the IT Department will review Internet connection audit reports created on the firewall for unusual or suspicious activities.
- Reviews must occur at least once a week.
- Alarms must be configured to alert the IT Administrator about suspected activities, security breaches, or violations.
- Events to be monitored include, but are not limited to, suspicious activities generated by the firewall.

### 4.4 Security Monitoring Limitations
The following activities are limited in terms of security monitoring:
- Initiation of a session from the external world
- Spoofing activities
- Suspicious activities occurring internally and from external sources
- Well-known hacker signatures
- Password guessing attempts
- Unauthorized use of privileges
- Modifications to production application software
- Modifications to system software

### 4.5 Windows Environment - Logging and Reporting
Effective logging and auditing in Windows is crucial for:
- Tracking attackers during a security breach
- Detecting unauthorized access attempts
- Identifying causes of errors or unauthorized changes
- Controlling changes to critical settings, such as the Registry

Recommended auditing and monitoring events include:
- Audit account logon events: Success, Failure
- Audit account management: Success, Failure
- Audit directory service access: Failure
- Audit logon events: Success, Failure
- Audit object access: Failure
- Audit policy change: Success, Failure
- Audit privilege use: Failure
- Audit process tracking: No auditing
- Audit system events: Success, Failure

### 4.6 UNIX Environment - Logging and Reporting
The following system logs should be reviewed and have restricted access:
- **/etc/wtmp**: Contains a history of system logins (requires UNIX utility for interpretation).
- **/usr/adm/sulog**: Logs the use of the `su` command, which can compromise security.
- **/usr/bin/uulog**: Contains a history of each use of `uucp`, `uuto`, and `uux`.
- **/etc/security/failedlogin**: Logs failed login attempts.
- Enable logging for specific commands (e.g., `kill`, `killall`, `chown`, `chmod`, `shutdown`, `chgrp`) using TCB (if installed).
- Maintain FTP logs due to the critical nature of FTP services; regular monitoring is recommended.

Important files to review include:
- **/usr/adm/syslog**
- **/usr/adm/messages** (or equivalent)

### 4.7 Oracle Environment - Logging and Reporting
Policies and procedures for reviewing audit trails should include:
- An archive rotation period (time before an archive can be overwritten)
- Security of audit trails (ensuring confidentiality and integrity)
- Redundancy of audit trails (disaster recovery planning)

The enabling of auditing features in a database should align with business and operational requirements, with the relevant department identifying necessary features.

### 4.7 Auditing Features

- Critical tables in the database must be kept confidential from the organization’s perspective.
- Auditing features can be enabled for critical areas.
- If user transactional level logs at the application level are captured, database-level auditing can be restricted to key actions, including:
  - Account logon
  - Modification to system settings
- These activities should be monitored for a period to analyze their impact on business operations and system performance.

The following auditing features can be logged based on requirements:
- Application Account Activity
- Failed Attempts to Access Objects
- Failed Attempts to Issue Sensitive Commands
- Failed Connections
- Failed Login Attempts
- Firecall Accounts: 
  - Firecall accounts have a very high level of privilege and are used only for emergency purposes.
  - Actions performed by these accounts must be audited to identify irregular or unauthorized use.
  - Auditing is necessary to retrace events during emergencies.
- SYSTEM Account Activity
- Vendor Account Activities

### 4.8 Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)

- Vulnerability analysis identifies and classifies security vulnerabilities in IT infrastructure.
- A penetration test evaluates security by attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in a safe manner.
- VAPT provides a comprehensive view of threats to information assets, enhancing protection against malicious attacks.
- Testing in a production environment during normal business hours may disrupt operations; therefore, a separate testing environment identical to production should be used.
- The testing environment must have the same application and network-layer controls as the production environment.
- Performing VAPT in a test environment prevents the production system from being pushed into an unknown state or disabled, ensuring detailed vulnerability reports can be obtained.
- All identified exploitable vulnerabilities must be corrected on production systems, and testing should be repeated to verify that security weaknesses have been addressed.
