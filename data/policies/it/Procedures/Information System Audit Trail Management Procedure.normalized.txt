### 1. Objectives
To monitor the logging of events, associate each logged event with a particular user, provide a mechanism to retrieve and report information on logged events, and report on the effectiveness and compliance with the ISO 27001:2022 standard.

### 2. Scope
This procedure applies to all Trianz users and operating units, including third parties, and all Trianz Information System Resources, including corporate data, applications, products, and systems software.

### 3. Reference(s)
None

### 4. Procedure

#### 4.1 Purpose of Monitoring
Monitoring of Trianz Information System Resources is conducted to:
- Safeguard information and computing resources from business and environmental threats.
- Ensure that information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals.
- Maintain the integrity of data.
- Ensure conformity to the Logical Access Security Policy and related procedures.

#### 4.2 Audit Trail Rules
- Auditing must be enabled on all servers and network devices to record exceptions and security-related events.
- All audit records should, if possible, be sent to a central server for monitoring and correlation.
- The IT Department must maintain all audit records for at least one month and a maximum of one year to assist in future investigations and access control monitoring.
- A record of successful system access, in addition to rejected attempts, must be created.
- At a minimum, audit trails must include:
  - User IDs
  - Dates and times for logon and logoff
  - Terminal identity or location

#### 4.3 Monitoring of System Use
System use must be monitored to ensure users are performing explicitly authorized processes. The level of monitoring required for individual systems should be determined by a separate risk assessment. Areas that must be monitored include:
- Access failures
- Allocation and use of accounts with privileged access capability
- Tracking of selected transactions
- Use of sensitive resources
- IDS/IPS activity
- Firewall activity
- Operating system and application access attempts
- Real-time alerts for publicly accessible systems (e.g., external websites) for any suspicious user activity.

#### 4.4 Monitoring of Firewall Audit Reports
- The designated IT Administrator in the IT Department will review the Internet connection audit reports created on the firewall for any unusual or suspicious activities.
- The period between reviews must not exceed one week.
- Alarms must be configured to alert the IT Administrator about any suspicious activities.

### 4.4 Monitoring and Security Events
The following events must be monitored for security breaches or violations:
- A session being initiated from the external world.
- Spoofing activities.
- Suspicious activities occurring internally and from external sources.
- Well-known hacker signatures.
- Password guessing attempts.
- Unauthorized use of privileges.
- Modifications to production application software.
- Modifications to system software.

### 4.5 Windows Environment
#### Logging and Reporting
- Windows provides monitoring and auditing tools for effective logging and auditing.
- Without auditing and logging, it may be impossible to:
  - Track attackers during a security breach.
  - Detect unauthorized access attempts.
  - Identify causes of errors or unauthorized changes.
  - Control changes to critical settings, such as the Registry.
- Detective controls are weakened without appropriate monitoring and auditing.
- It is recommended to use Windows auditing and monitoring features effectively, focusing on selected events to minimize performance impact. Suggested events to log include:
  - Audit account logon events: Success, Failure.
  - Audit account management: Success, Failure.
  - Audit directory service access: Failure.
  - Audit logon events: Success, Failure.
  - Audit object access: Failure.
  - Audit policy change: Success, Failure.
  - Audit privilege use: Failure.
  - Audit process tracking: No auditing.
  - Audit system events: Success, Failure.

### 4.6 UNIX Environment
#### Logging and Reporting
The following system logs should be reviewed and have restricted access:
- **/etc/wtmp**: Contains a history of system logins (requires UNIX utility for interpretation).
- **/usr/adm/sulog**: Logs the use of the `su` command, which can compromise security.
- **/usr/bin/uulog**: Contains a history of each use of `uucp`, `uuto`, and `uux`.
- **/etc/security/failedlogin**: Logs failed login attempts.
- Enable logging for specific commands (e.g., `kill`, `killall`, `chown`, `chmod`, `shutdown`, `chgrp`) using TCB (if installed).
- Maintain FTP logs due to the critical nature of FTP services; regular monitoring of FTP activities is recommended.

**Note**: The most important files to review are **/usr/adm/syslog** and **/usr/adm/messages** (or equivalent). Enabling only selected auditing features may have limited impact on application or server performance.

### 4.7 Oracle Environment
#### Logging and Reporting
- Policies and procedures must be established to review audit trails in a timely manner and develop an audit trail archiving strategy. This strategy should address:
  - Archive rotation period (time before an archive can be overwritten).
  - Security of audit trails (confidentiality and integrity).
  - Redundancy of audit trails (disaster recovery planning).
- The enabling of auditing features in a database should be conducted according to established policies.

### 4.6 Auditing Features

1. **Identification of Critical Tables**: The concerned Department must identify critical tables in a database that need to be kept confidential. Auditing features can then be enabled for these areas.

2. **User Transaction Logs**: If user transactional level details are captured at the application level, database-level auditing can be restricted to key actions, including:
   - Account logon
   - Modification to system settings

   These actions should be evaluated for their impact on business operations and monitored over time to analyze their effect on system performance.

3. **Auditing Features to be Logged**: The following auditing features may be logged based on requirements:
   - Application Account Activity
   - Failed Attempts to Access Objects
   - Failed Attempts to Issue Sensitive Commands
   - Failed Connections
   - Failed Login Attempts
   - Firecall Accounts: 
     - Firecall accounts have a high level of privilege and are used only for emergencies. 
     - Actions performed by these accounts must be audited to identify irregular or unauthorized use and to reference events during emergencies.
   - SYSTEM Account Activity
   - Vendor Account Activities

### 4.7 Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)

1. **Vulnerability Analysis**: This process defines, identifies, and classifies security vulnerabilities in computer, network, or communications infrastructure.

2. **Penetration Testing**: A penetration test evaluates the security of IT infrastructure by attempting to exploit vulnerabilities, which may exist in:
   - Operating systems
   - Service and application flaws
   - Improper configurations
   - Risky end-user behavior

3. **Purpose of VAPT**: VAPT provides a comprehensive view of threats to Trianz's information assets, enabling better protection against malicious attacks.

4. **Testing Environment**: 
   - VAPT should not disrupt business operations; therefore, testing should occur in a separate environment identical to production.
   - The testing environment must have the same application and network-layer controls as the production environment.

5. **Impact of Testing**: Direct attacks during testing can push systems into unknown states or disable them, which may hinder future testing and vulnerability reporting.

6. **Correction of Vulnerabilities**: All exploitable vulnerabilities identified during testing must be corrected on production systems, and testing should be repeated to verify that security weaknesses have been addressed.
