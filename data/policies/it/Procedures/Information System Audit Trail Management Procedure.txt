1. Objectives
   To monitor the logging of events, association of each logged event with a
   particular user, provision or a mechanism to retrieve and report information on
   logged events and reporting on the effectiveness and compliance with ISO
   27001:2022 standard.


2. Scope
   This procedure applies to all Trianz users and operating units including the third
   parties, and all Trianz Information System Resources including corporate data, as
   well as the application, products and systems software


3. Reference(s)
    None
4. Procedure

  4.1 Purpose of Monitoring
       In order to safeguard information and computing resources from various
       business and environmental threats, the activities related to the use of Trianz
       Information System Resources monitoring will be done. It will also ensure that
       the information on these systems is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals
       and that the integrity of the data is maintained. Monitoring is also done to
       ensure conformity to Logical Access Security Policy and related procedures
       Back-up Methods


  4.2 Audit Trail Rules
       Auditing must be enabled on all the Servers and Network Devices for recording
       exceptions and other security-related events. If possible, all audit records
       should be sent to central server for monitoring and correlation. IT Department
       to maintain all audit records for at least one month and maximum to a period
       of one year to assist in future investigations and access control monitoring. A
       record of successful system access, in addition to rejected attempts, should be
       created. At a minimum, audit trails must include the following:-

           •      User ID’s

TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                    Page 4 of 15
          •       Dates and times for logon and logoff
          •       Terminal identity or location


  4.3 Monitoring of System Use
       The systems use must be monitored to ensure that users are performing
       processes that have been explicitly authorized. The level of monitoring required
       for individual systems should be determined by a separate risk assessment.
       Areas that must be monitored are:

              •    Access failures
              •    Allocation and use of accounts with a privileged access capability
              •    Tracking of selected transactions
              •    The use of sensitive resources
              •    IDS/IPS activity
              •    Firewall activity
              •    O/S and application access attempts
              •    Real-time alerts for publicly accessible systems (e.g. external web sites)
                   for any suspicious user activity.


  4.4 Monitoring of Firewall Audit Reports
       The designated IT Administrator in IT Department will review the Internet
       connection audit reports created on the firewall for any unusual/suspicious
       activities. The period between reviews should not exceed a week. Alarms must
       be configured to alert the IT Administrator about any suspected activities,
       security breaches or violations and any other related events generated by the
       firewall. The events to be monitored include, but not limited to:

              •    A session being initiated from the external world
              •    Spoofing activities
              •    Suspicious activities taking place internally and from external sources
              •    Well known hacker signatures
              •    Password guessing attempts
              •    Attempts to use privileges that have not been authorized
              •    Modifications to production application software
              •    Modification to system software

  4.5 Windows Environment
         •   Logging and reporting
         •   Details/Test:
         •   Windows comes with several monitoring and auditing tools, which enable
             powerful logging and auditing. In the absence of auditing and logging, it
             may not be possible to:
         •   Track the attacker in the event of a security breach
         •   Detect unauthorized access attempts to resources.
         •   Track the causes for errors or unauthorized changes (if any).
         •   Have control over changes to critical settings, like the Registry.
         •   Thus, detective controls become very weak in the absence of appropriate
             monitoring and auditing.
         •   It is recommended that the auditing and monitoring features of Windows
             be used effectively. There are apprehensions that logging and auditing
             everything will bloat the log and would also result in performance
             degradation. However, we suggest that by logging and auditing only
             selected events based on business needs and requirements, there may
             be limited effect on the performance of the system. Some of such events
             are:
                    ➢   Audit account logon events = Success, Failure
                    ➢   Audit account management = Success, Failure
                    ➢   Audit directory service access = Failure
                    ➢   Audit logon events = Success, Failure
                    ➢   Audit object access = Failure
                    ➢   Audit policy change = Success, Failure
                    ➢   Audit privilege use = Failure
                    ➢   Audit process tracking = No auditing
                    ➢   Audit system events = Success, Failure


  4.6 UNIX Environment
         •   Logging and reporting
         •   Details/Test:
         •   The following system logs should be reviewed and have restricted access:



TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                    Page 6 of 15
       ➢ /etc/wtmp - contains a history of system logins. (This file is not plain text
           and needs to be interpreted by a UNIX utility such as “who”.
       ➢ /usr/adm/sulog - Review the contents of this file, it logs the use of the su
           command. The su (super user) command can compromise security by
           accessing files belonging to other users without their knowledge. In order to
           access such files, the password of the file owner must be known. Use of this
           command will evidence the inappropriate use of a password by other users.
       ➢ /usr/bin/uulog - contains a history of each use of uucp, uuto, and uux.
       ➢ /etc/security/failedlogin - Review the log to determine list of failed login.
       ➢ Enable logging for specific commands such as kill, killall, chown, chmod,
           shutdown and chgrp using TCB (if installed)
       ➢ In case of FTP services, FTP logs should also be maintained as this service is
           highly critical and sensitive from security aspects, therefore, it is
           recommended to monitor the FTP activities regularly.

  Note: The most important files to be reviewed are /usr/adm/syslog and

  /usr/adm/messages (or equivalent). Enabling only selected auditing features may

  have limited affect on the performance of the Application or Server.



   4.7 Oracle Environment
   •    Logging and reporting


   •    Details/Test:


   •    Policies and procedures to review audit trails in a timely manner and

        developing an audit trail archiving strategy should be adopted. This strategy

        should address the following:

        ➢ archive rotation period (the amount of time before an archive can be
            overwritten);
        ➢ security of the audit trails - archive logs (confidentiality and integrity); and
        ➢ redundancy of the audit trails (disaster recovery planning)



TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                        Page 7 of 15
   •    The enabling of auditing feature in a database should be as per the business
        and operational requirements. The concerned Department should first identify
        the relevant critical tables in a database which are required to be kept
        confidential from the organization’s perspective and then the auditing
        features can be enabled for those critical areas.

   •    We need to ensure that if logs of the User transactional level details at
        Application level are being captured, then the Auditing at Database Level can
        be restricted to key actions such as account logon, modification to system
        settings, etc. These activities can be identified after evaluating their impact on
        the business or operations and should be monitored for a period to analyse
        the affect on the performance of the system.

   •    The following auditing features can be logged depending upon the

        requirements:-

   •    Application Account Activity
   •    Failed Attempts to Access Objects
   •    Failed Attempts to Issue Sensitive Commands
   •    Failed Connections
   •    Failed Login Attempts
   •    Firecall Accounts:- 'Firecall' accounts have a very high, if not unlimited, level of
        privilege within a database. These accounts are only used for emergency
        purposes and should be secured accordingly. Actions performed by these
        accounts should be audited for identification of irregular and/or unauthorized
        use or as a reference as to what occurred when a 'Firecall' account was used
        in an emergency. If actions performed by 'Firecall' accounts are not audited,
        use of these accounts in an irregular or unauthorized manner could go
        unnoticed. Additionally, retracing the events that occurred during an
        emergency would not be possible.
   •    SYSTEM Account Activity
   •    Vendor Account Activities

4.7 Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)
     Vulnerability analysis, also known as vulnerability assessment, is a process that
     defines, identifies, and classifies the security holes (vulnerabilities) in a computer,
     network, or communications infrastructure.

     A penetration test, or pen test, is an attempt to evaluate the security of an IT
     infrastructure by safely trying to exploit vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities may
     exist in operating systems, service and application flaws, improper configurations,
     or risky end- user behavior.

     VAPT provides Trianz with a comprehensive and detailed view of the threats
     facing its Information assets, enabling it to better protect its systems and data
     from malicious attacks.

     However, because of the nature and the intent of VAPT, such testing in a
     production environment during normal business hours may impact business
     operations. To avoid disruptions and to speed up testing, a separate environment
     that is identical to the production environment may be used for testing instead of
     the production environment, ensure the same application and network-layer
     controls as production exist in the testing environment.

     Another advantage of performing VAPT in a test environment is that by directly
     performing attacks against a system being audited, the attack script can push
     the system into an unknown state or completely disable it making the remote
     system useless for further testing and virtually eliminating the possibility of
     attaining detailed vulnerability reports against this device from future tests

     All exploitable vulnerabilities identified during the testing must be corrected on
     production systems and testing repeated to verify that security weaknesses have
     been addressed.
