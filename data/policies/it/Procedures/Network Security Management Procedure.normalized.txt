## 3. Scope
- This procedure applies to networks and networked services established at Trianz and to all Trianz products and services managed.

## 4. Procedure

### 4.1 Network Security

#### 4.1.1 Network Administration
- Trianz IS systems will connect through the corporate network, which serves as the backbone for data and information exchange.
- Network and telecommunication controls will be deployed to protect critical and business-sensitive information from unauthorized access.
- The designated IS Administrator in the IS Department is responsible for corporate network administration.
- Designated IS Administrators will regularly review and monitor network configurations and implement safeguards for security.
- All equipment connected to the Trianz network will be monitored by IS Administrators through a tool that performs the following activities:
  - Identifies network devices connected to the Trianz network.
  - Tracks approved devices (Desktops, Laptops, Servers, Printers, Switches, Routers) with user name, MAC address, IP address, and network port.
  - Monitors software and anti-virus updates for systems (including desktops, laptops, and servers).
- The Head of IS will maintain a list of designated IS Administrators who can access routers and other network devices.

### 4.1.2 Network Communication Security
- The designated IS Administrator in the IS Department must change the default passwords of all network devices, including routers.
- IS Administrators are required to use access control lists on routers.
- Software for unattended file transfers must authenticate the origin and destination file names, as well as any user submitting the request.
- All system access must be logged, and log files should not be overwritten or deleted until they are backed up to offline storage.
- Internal Network Security will be maintained by creating different VLANs to restrict employee access to data on different VLANs, based on business risk perception by management.
- VLANs will be segregated at the core switch, with inter-VLAN communication occurring solely through the core switch.

### 4.1.3 Connectivity
- All network connection points must be marked and identified.
- Unused connections, services, and network segments must be disconnected from active networks.
- The IS team will assess the suitability of new hardware/software, particularly for protocol compatibility, before allowing connections to Trianz's corporate network.
- No desktops or laptops may connect to the LAN without approval from the Head of IS.
- Heads of Departments must request network connectivity for third-party laptops to any unused network terminals through the IS Helpdesk using a Service Request.
- A periodic LAN/WAN utilization report will be generated to monitor and identify future bandwidth requirements and unfavorable link utilization, governed by the Policy for Capacity Management.
- Additional security for high-risk applications will be provided by implementing an IPS/IDS on the network segment, which will reset/block connections that could lead to DoS attacks.

### 4.1.4 Access Control and Security of Remote Users
- The IS Administrator will monitor remote user VPN connections, including log in and log out times, using a monitoring tool.
- The tool will generate reports for VPN users connecting to the Trianz network over the internet.
- Authentication for all users connecting to the Trianz network will be controlled by a firewall.
- Trianz will provide secured access (VPN tunnel) to its web-enabled business and/or internal applications and/or servers.

### 4.1.5 Router Security
- All routers must support IPSec encryption standards, such as 3DES/AES, if supported by the Router Manufacturer, Model, and Make.
- All unused services and daemons on routers must be disabled or blocked.
- Access Control Lists must be configured on each router.
- Syslog (router logs) from all routers will be directed to a centralized log server.
- Remote access to all routers will be permitted only from the desktop of designated System Administrators.

### 4.1.5 Routers

- Access to routers will be via console only in worst-case scenarios when the network administrator cannot connect due to network issues.
- A network management tool will be deployed to monitor network traffic, memory, and CPU utilization to prevent congestion at the gateways (routers) and take necessary actions as per the Policy for Capacity Planning.
- Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting should be implemented using AD/RADIUS/TACACS+ where possible.
- Configuration of all routers will be centrally stored at the Central Location with the Head of IS for auditing, reference, and backup purposes.
- SSH-based telnet services will be used for all communication with the router.
- Any changes to the router configuration must be approved by the Head of IS in accordance with the Policy for Change Management.

### 4.1.6 Firewalls

Each firewall introduced into the Trianz network must adhere to the following rules:

- Identify network applications that require access via the firewall.
- Identify TCP/UDP ports that should be allowed for the identified applications.
- Identify source and destination IP address ranges for the identified applications.
- Create a firewall rule base based on application traffic, allowing communication only on identified ports between specified source and destination IP ranges. Exceptions may be permitted to allow all ports for technical reasons, but only between specific source and destination IP address ranges.
- Block traffic from any identified infected or malicious source.
- All changes to the firewall rule base and/or policies must be approved by the Head of IS, following the policy for change management (Refer to the System and Software Change Management Policy).

While assembling the rule base, the following traffic will be blocked:

- Inbound traffic from a non-authenticated source system directed at the firewall itself, which typically indicates a probe or attack.
- Inbound traffic with a source address from a network behind the firewall, likely indicating a spoofing attempt.
- Inbound traffic containing ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) traffic, as it can be used to map networks behind firewalls and should never be allowed from the Internet or untrusted external networks.
- Inbound traffic from a system with a source address within the RFC 1918 reserved ranges for private networks, which are:
  - 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 (Class A)
  - 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 (Class B)
  - 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 (Class C)
  
  Inbound traffic from these addresses may indicate the start of a denial-of-service attack.
  
- Inbound traffic from a non-authenticated source system containing SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) traffic, which may indicate network probing by an intruder.
- Inbound traffic containing IP Source Routing information, which can allow an attacker to bypass firewall controls.
- Inbound or outbound traffic with a source or destination address of 127.0.0.1 (local host), which typically indicates an attack against the firewall system itself.

### 1. Address Blocking
- The address 0.0.0.0 must be blocked to prevent potential attacks, as some operating systems may interpret it as a local host or broadcast address.

### 2. Connection Time Restrictions
- Restrictions on connection times must be implemented to enhance security for high-risk applications. This can be achieved by:
  - Implementing an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) or Intrusion Detection System (IDS) on the network segment to reset or block connections that could lead to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

### 3. Inbound Traffic Blocking
- Inbound traffic containing directed broadcast addresses must be blocked to prevent broadcast propagation attacks, such as SMURF attacks. Directed broadcasts can allow a system to send a broadcast message with a spoofed source address, leading to excessive network traffic.

### 4. Testing Firewall Controls
1. **Methodology for Testing:**
   - Obtain hardcopies of firewall configurations and compare them against the expected configuration based on defined policies.
   - Conduct in-place configuration testing by the designated IS Administrator to assess the device's configuration by attempting prohibited operations.

### 5. Access to Firewall Platform
- Secure access to the firewall platform must include:
  - Controlled access to the operating system console and graphic management interface using encryption and/or strong user authentication, with IP address restrictions.
  - Use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for graphic management interfaces that utilize HTTP.

### 6. Firewall Backup
- Firewall backups must be conducted as follows:
  - Backups should be performed immediately prior to production release.
  - Backups must be retained for a minimum period of three months.

### 7. Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS)
- Network-based IDS/IPS must be implemented at all gateways to monitor all inbound and outbound network traffic in promiscuous mode.
- The IDS/IPS must generate alerts or alarms for any identified unfavorable or malicious activity to notify the security administrator immediately.
- The IDS must be configured and managed from a centralized IDS Console, where security and response policies will be stored.
- Upgrades, updates, hot-fixes, and patches must be applied to the IDS and documented.
- IDS signatures must be regularly updated, with documentation logging the update number, time of application, and a brief description of changes.
- All alert logs from the network-based IDS must be forwarded to the centralized IDS Console.
- The designated IS administrator must apply the latest patches or attack signature updates to all IDS sensors via the centralized IDS Console.
- The designated IS administrator must configure security patches, updates, or upgrades for the respective IDS sensors and back up the existing IDS security or response policy before applying changes.

### 5. ISO Control Mapping

#### 5.1 Backup and Reporting
- A backup of the IDS policy must be taken before any modifications or changes to the existing security policy.
- Periodic backups of the IDS security policy, response policy, and security logs must be conducted every six months.
- Multiple backup copies should be created and stored in a safe environment, preferably in the cloud.
- Reports from security alert logs should be generated at least weekly.

#### 5.2 Network Security Measures
- Co-relation of network-based IDS must be performed to identify malicious or unfavorable activity patterns within the Trianz network, allowing for precautionary measures to block such activities in the future or during incidents.
- Restrictions on connection times should be implemented for high-risk applications by using an IPS/IDS on the network segment to reset or block connections that could lead to DoS attacks.
- In response to illegal or hacking activities, the IDS will take appropriate steps, including:
  - Dropping the malicious connection.
  - Reconfiguring the firewall to block connections from the source IP address.

### 4.2 Network Services Security & Network Services Access Control

#### 4.2.1 Authentication for External Connections
- Authentication for external connections is conducted through SSL VPN using the Kerberos protocol.

#### 4.2.2 Segregation of Networks
- Networks are segregated using VLAN methodology based on business units.

#### 4.2.3 Remote and Diagnostic Port Protection
- Remote and diagnostic ports are protected by blocking ICMP.

### 4.3 Zero Trust Principles
- Trianz will implement a strict zero trust network architecture to prevent network security breaches and reduce the blast radius in case of a breach, avoiding reliance solely on perimeter security.
- A "never trust and always verify" approach will be adopted for access to information systems, ensuring that requests are encrypted end-to-end.
- Each request to an information system will be verified as if it originated from an open, external network, regardless of whether it came from inside the organization.
- Trianz will adhere to "least privilege" and dynamic access control techniques, authenticating and authorizing requests based on contextual information such as:
  - Authentication information.
  - User identities.
  - Data about the user endpoint device.
  - Data classification.
- Strong authentication methods will be enforced, including multi-factor authentication, endpoint agents, location-based, and attribute-based controls.
