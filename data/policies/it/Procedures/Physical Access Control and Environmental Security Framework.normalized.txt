## 1. Introduction
Physical access control and environmental security are essential for protecting Trianz’s information assets. The framework establishes multiple physical barriers around business processes and information processing facilities. The security system should include at least four layers of physical access security:
- Environmental design
- Mechanical and electronic access control
- Intrusion detection
- Video monitoring

The goal is to deter potential attackers by ensuring that the cost of an attack exceeds its potential value.

## 2. Objectives
The objective of this framework is to establish physical access controls to protect Trianz’s information assets from unauthorized physical access, damage, and interference.

## 3. Scope
This framework applies to:
- Information assets
- All users (employees, consultants, contractors, and third parties) who have access to Trianz’s information processing systems and premises.
