## 4. Procedure

### 4.1 Desktop / Workstation
- Every system (PC, Laptop, etc.) must have the Organization Standard corporate anti-virus software installed.
- The anti-virus software must be regularly updated with the latest patches, which will occur automatically if connected to the Trianz network.
- Employees are responsible for ensuring their desktop/laptop has the latest anti-virus signature files and is virus-free.
- In cases of zero-day signature updates, the IT team will perform manual updates.

### 4.2 Servers
- The latest anti-virus pattern file will be automatically downloaded and updated on the servers.
- In cases of zero-day signature updates, the IT team will perform manual updates.

### 4.3 Gateway Anti-virus
- **For Internet Connection**: The gateway anti-virus must monitor all inbound connections and filter out malicious content being downloaded from the Internet.
- **For E-mail**: The gateway anti-virus must monitor all inbound and outgoing mail to the Trianz mail server and filter out emails containing viruses.

### 4.4 Users
- Users must have the organization-standardized anti-virus software installed on their computers, if not installed by default, by the IT Helpdesk Executive.
- Users must regularly scan their computers using the installed anti-virus software.
- Users must ensure their anti-virus software is regularly updated to account for new viruses and variants.
- Users must always scan removable storage media before accessing files.
- Users should save critical files on a centralized file server, which is regularly scanned and backed up, to prevent data loss from virus infections.
- Users must scan files downloaded from the Internet prior to running them.
- Users must not run pirated programs, as they are a major source of viruses.
- Users must not stop, remove, or uninstall the anti-virus software from their computers.
- Users must not download programs from untrusted or suspicious Internet sites or networks. Categorized Web Filtering is enabled, but users are expected to exercise discretion.

### 4.5 Virus Detection and Prevention Tips

- Users must not open any files attached to emails from unknown, suspicious, or untrustworthy sources.
- Users should not open any files attached to emails unless they are certain of the file's content, even if the email appears to be from a known contact, as some viruses can replicate and spread through email.
- Users must not open files attached to emails with questionable or unexpected subject lines. If necessary, save the file to the hard drive before opening it.
- Users are required to update their anti-virus software regularly, as new viruses are discovered frequently.
- Users must back up files regularly to a local file server. If a virus destroys data files, they can be replaced with backup copies.
- When in doubt, users should not open, download, or execute any files or email attachments.

#### Symptoms of Virus
- The program takes longer to load suddenly.
- The program size keeps changing.
- The disk keeps running out of free space.
- The drive light keeps flashing when the user is not performing any actions.
- Files have strange names that are not recognizable.
- The computer is unable to remember CMOS settings.
- System memory decreases.
- Icons change in appearance.

### 4.6 Contact with Special Interested Groups
- Trianz may seek assistance from external consultants on information security for support or critical decision-making processes.
