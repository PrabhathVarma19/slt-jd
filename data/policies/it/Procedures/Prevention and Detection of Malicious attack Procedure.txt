1. Objective
      The purpose of this control is to device a high performance policy-based anti-virus and
      content for Trianz to protect the enterprise’s network and system from virus attacks,
      worms, Internet borne email viruses and prevent transmission of spam or non-business
      related contents


2. Scope
      This control is applicable to all Trianz associates. It covers workstations/servers/devices
      located on TRIANZ’s networks or which are connected to Trianz Infrastructure. It is
      applicable to all systems under the jurisdiction and/or ownership of TRIANZ, inclusive of
      hired systems. This control also covers all workstations and servers supplied by the
      customers of TRIANZ, as long as they are operated from within TRIANZ premises and
      all Trianz products and services.


3. Reference(s)
      None


4. Procedure

  4.1 Desktop / Workstation
      Every system (i.e. PC, Laptop, etc.) must have Organization Standard corporate anti-
      virus software installed, which has to be regularly updated with latest patches. This will
      be done automatically if you are connected to the Trianz network. It is the responsibility
      of every employee at Trianz to ensure that his/her desktop/laptop has the latest pattern
      for the Anti-Virus signature files and ensures that the same is virus free.
      In cases of zero-day signature update, same will be done manually by the IT team.




  4.2 Servers
      Latest anti-virus pattern file will be downloaded automatically, and updated on the
      Servers. In cases of zero-day signature update, same will be done manually by the IT
      team




TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                                4
  4.3 Gateway Anti-virus
    •     For Internet Connection

          The gateway Anti-Virus should monitor all inbound connections and accordingly filter
          out all malicious content which is being downloaded from the Internet.

    •     For E-mail

        The gateway anti-virus should monitor all inbound and outgoing mail to Trianz mail
        server and accordingly filter out mails containing viruses.


  4.4 Users
    •     Have the organization-standardized anti-virus software installed (if not installed by
          default) on your computer by IT Helpdesk Executive.
    •     Regularly scan your computer using the anti-virus software installed on your computer.

    •     Make sure that your anti-virus software is regularly updated to take into account new
          viruses and variants recently written.
    •     Always scan the removable storage media before accessing the files.

    •     In addition to saving your data files (documents, spreadsheets, etc.) to the hard drive,
          consider saving the critical files in centralized file server. The file server drives are
          scanned & backed up regularly. Having a backup of your data files may prevent data
          loss if a virus infects your hard drive.
    •     While downloading files/information from the Internet, always scan the files prior to
          running them.
    •     Do not run any Pirated programs on computer as pirated programs are a major source
          of viruses.
    •     Do not stop, remove or uninstall the Anti-Virus software from your computer.
    •     Do not download programs from any un-trusted or suspicious Internet site or networks.
          Categorized Web Filtering has been enabled to ensure this, however, the users are
          expected to exercise discretion while surfing the net.
    •     If any user feels that his/her desktop/laptop is infected with virus then it is his/her
          responsibility to inform the IT helpdesk about the same, through e-mail or in person

  4.5 Virus Detection and Prevention Tips
    •     Do not open any files attached to an email from an unknown, suspicious or
          untrustworthy source
    •     Do not open any files attached to an email unless you know what it is, even if it appears
          to come from someone you know. Some viruses can replicate themselves and spread
          through email
    •     Do not open any files attached to an email if the subject line is questionable or
          unexpected. If the need to do so, always save the file to your hard drive before doing so
    •     Update the anti-virus software regularly as lots of new viruses are discovered each
          month.
    •     Back up the files on a regular basis to local file server. If a virus destroys the data files,
          they can be replaced with the back-up copy.
           • When in doubt, do not open, download, or execute any files or email attachments

               Symptoms of virus

           •   The program takes longer to load suddenly
           •   The program size keeps changing
           •   The disk keeps running out of free space
           •   The drive light keeps flashing when the user is not doing anything
           •   The files have strange names which are not recognizable
           •   The computer is not able to remember CMOS settings
           •   System memory reduces Icons change in appearance



  4.6 Contact with Special Interested groups
        Trianz can take the help of external consultant on information security in case of any
        support or critical decision making processes.
