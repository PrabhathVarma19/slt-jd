- The product of the quantified values of Impact and Probability is referred to as "Risk Magnitude."
- Following Risk Analysis and Evaluation, Risk Treatment will be implemented.

### 8.3 Risk Treatment
- For risks with a magnitude of 27 or greater, a Risk Treatment plan and a Risk Contingency plan will be developed.
- The risk owner will identify applicable Risk Treatment strategies from the following categories:
  - **Avoid the Risk:** Change the plan completely to avoid the risk.
  - **Take on more Risk:** Accept or increase the risk to pursue an opportunity.
  - **Remove the Risk Source:** Modify the risk by eliminating its source.
  - **Change the Probability:** Alter the likelihood of the risk occurring.
  - **Alter the Consequences:** Change the outcome or consequences of the risk event.
  - **Share the Risk:** Distribute the risk with other parties, including through insurance.
  - **Implement Controls:** Introduce controls to reduce the risk to an acceptable level.
  - **Accept / Retain the Risk:** Make an informed decision to retain the risk when it is deemed acceptable.
- If an identified risk has already occurred, the contingency plan will be executed. If there is no residual risk, the risk is considered mitigated.

### 8.4 Risk Monitoring
- Risk monitoring involves implementing and overseeing appropriate risk response strategies.
- If an identified risk has occurred, the contingency plan will be executed, and if any residual risk remains, Risk Treatment will be applied as previously stated.
- Residual risks must be verified to ensure they meet acceptable levels of risk magnitude (≤ 9).
- If the residual risk is at an acceptable level, it is considered mitigated.
- The Risk Owner will systematically track identified risks in the Risk Management Register, and Risk Treatment will be monitored periodically.
- A Risk Management report will be generated and presented to the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) on a regular basis.
- The DA/PMO/Information Security Team will verify the status of Risk Treatment and Contingency plan implementations.
- Risk Management is an ongoing process; new risks will be identified, assessed, and monitored in the Risk Management Register periodically.
- The Risk Owner will document lessons learned for future risk assessments using the Risk Database, which includes a history of risks.

### 8.5 Identification of Opportunities
- Opportunities arising from uncertainties should be identified, explored, treated appropriately, and monitored.

### 9. Process Description – Asset Risk Management
- Risk identification is an ongoing activity for all assets, based on inputs from all stakeholders.
- Risks will be updated in the Weekly PMO Tool/Risk and Opportunity Management Module and monitored periodically by the PMO/DA and Information Security Team.

- **Software Assets**: Comprises application software, system software, development tools, utilities, and software licenses.
  
- **Physical/Hardware Assets/Infra Assets**: Encompasses computer equipment, communications equipment, removable media, and other equipment.
  
- **Services**: Covers computing and communications services, and general utilities (e.g., heating, lighting, power, and air-conditioning).
  
- **Human Resources**: Refers to employees, including their qualifications, skills, and experience.

- Assets of similar functionality within each category will be identified to determine assets that are identical in functionality and nature.

### 9.2 Identification of CIAP Values and Calculation of Asset Value
For identified assets, the following values will be assigned:

- **Confidentiality**: 
  - 1: Public to everyone
  - 3: Restricted, available within Trianz but not outside
  - 9: Sensitive Information, based on need

- **Integrity**: 
  - 1: Unauthorized modification or destruction of the information could have limited effect on organizational operations or assets.
  - 3: Unauthorized modification or destruction of the information could have some effect on organizational operations or assets.
  - 9: Unauthorized modification or destruction of the information could have serious effect on organizational operations or assets.

- **Availability**: 
  - 1: Disruption of access to or use of the asset could have limited effect on organizational operations or assets.
  - 3: Disruption of access to or use of the asset could have some effect on organizational operations or assets.
  - 9: Disruption of access to or use of the asset could have serious effect on organizational operations or assets.

- **Privacy**: 
  - The property of protecting information about an individual or group to allow them to express themselves selectively. 

### Risk Management Rules
- The risk owner is defined as the person or entity accountable for managing a risk.
- The asset owner is responsible for protecting the Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Privacy (C, I, A, P) of the asset.
- Asset value must be calculated based on C, I, A, and P values.
- If the asset value is greater than or equal to 81, a 'Risk Assessment' must be performed.
- Threats, existing controls, vulnerabilities, impact, and probability of occurrence of vulnerabilities must be identified.
- Risk Magnitude is calculated based on the Impact value and Probability value.
- If Risk Magnitude is greater than or equal to 81, the risk should be treated or transferred.

**Note**: Asset ownership relates to operational control, while risk ownership pertains to business risk.

### 9.3 Risk Assessment Methodology
- Identify threats for each asset type, including:
  - Fire
  - Flood
  - Theft
  - Building/Structure Collapse
  - Water Leakage
  - Non-Availability of Resources (associates, software/hardware, etc.)
- Refer to the list of threats in Appendix A: List of Threats.
- Identify existing controls for each threat.
- Identify and map applicable vulnerabilities to threats.

- Risks associated with assets having a risk value of 81 or greater must be treated with adequate control implementation.

### 9.5 Risk Treatment
- Risk treatment will occur under the following conditions:
  - If the risk value is 81 or greater, the risk will be treated or transferred.
- Identify vulnerabilities for the identified assets.
- For each vulnerability, identify a set of threats that can exploit it.
- Assign values for 'Impact' and 'Probability' based on the identified threats, vulnerabilities, and existing controls.
  - Probability measures the likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.
  - Impact measures the adverse effects of a security event in terms of loss or degradation of CIAP (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Privacy).
- Calculate risk magnitude as Impact * Probability.
- Risks with a magnitude greater than 27 are considered high, requiring mitigation plans/security controls.
- Select risk handling options based on risk magnitude:
  - Avoid Risk
  - Accept Risk
  - Transfer Risk
  - Treat Risk
- After implementing controls, reassess impact and probability values.
- Calculate residual risk as the product of Impact & Probability after controls are implemented.
- Verify that residual risks are at acceptable levels (risk magnitude ≤ 9).
- The project manager and/or Function Head will own the risk.
- Identify and record information security and business continuity risks in the PM workbook/PMO Tool.
