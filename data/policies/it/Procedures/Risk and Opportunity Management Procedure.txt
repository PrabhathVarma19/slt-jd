8. Process Description - Projects

   8.1 Risk Identification -Projects
   The risk is a result of a threat actor exploiting the vulnerability present in the
   system/Project

   •     Risk identification is an on-going activity across Trianz

   •     Risks will be identified basis the inputs from all stakeholders

   •     Risks would be updated in Weekly PMO Tool/Risk Management Module and
         monitored by PMO /DA and Infosec Team on periodic basis.

   •     Risks would be identified based on the impact that would be created on Quality
         Management System, Service Management System, Information Security
         including Cloud Security and Data Privacy.

   •     The details associated with each risk are filled in the Risk Management Register

   •     Risks Specific to Quality Management System and Service Management System
         would be identified in the following ways:

         o   Impact on Scope, Schedule & Effort o Impact on Quality & Cost o Impact of

             New Technologies o Impact on Resources – Skills etc.

   •     Risks Specific to Service Management System would be identified in the following
         ways:

        o    Risks due to External issues that include market, political, economic, and
             environmental influences, competition, laws and regulations, external
             customer demands, and the likelihood of events that could affect the services.

        o    Risks due to Internal issues that include policies, resources, capabilities,
             people, skills and knowledge, organizational structure, governance, culture,
             internal customer demands, and finance

•       Refer Risk Sources –Appendix




8.2 Risk Analysis & Evaluation
    •       Risk owner would analyze the risks.

    •       Risk owner evaluates the risk and assesses the probability & impact of the risk
            and details them in the Risk Management Register.

    •       Impact and Probability would be quantified as follows

                    Impact               Rating (Scale)

                     High                              9

                    Medium                             3

                    Low                                 1



                    Probability          Rating (Scale)

                    High                               9

                    Medium                             3

                    Low                                 1



        Product of quantified values of Impact and Probability is “Risk Magnitude “ After
        Risk Analysis & Risk Evaluation, Risk Treatment will follow.

8.3 Risk Treatment
    Once Risk Magnitude is calculated, for those risks that have magnitude >=27,
    Risk Treatment plan, and Risk contingency plan would be identified

    Risk owner identifies the Risk Treatment applicable against each risk as per
    below categories.

    Avoid the Risk: Avoid the Risk in case of changing the plan completely

    Take on more Risk: Taking or increasing the risk in order to pursue an
    opportunity;

    Remove the Risk Source: By removing the risk source a risk would be modified
    to the desired level

    Change the Probability: Altering or Changing the likelihood could be the best
    risk treatment option

    Alter the Consequences: Altering the outcome or changing the consequences
    of an event can modify the risk

    Share the Risk: Just like a problem shared is half way solved, so also, Sharing
    the risk with another party or parties, including insurance and other
    mechanisms could be an effective risk treatment

    Implement Controls: Implement suitable controls to mitigate the risk so that
    the risk value is brought down to the acceptable level

    Accept / Retain the Risk: Retaining the risk by informed decision, this is critical
    when it is about risk-benefit and acceptable for the organization

    When the Identified risk already occurred, contingency plan would be executed
    If there is no residual risk the risk is mitigated




8.4 Risk Monitoring
    This involves the implementation and monitoring of appropriate risk response
    strategies.




TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                       10
       When the Identified risk already occurred, contingency plan would be executed
       and if there is any residual risk after implementing contingency plan, Risk
       Treatment would be applicable as stated in the above section.

       Residual risks shall be verified for the acceptable levels of risk magnitude < =9

       If residual risk is meeting the acceptable level the risk is considered as
       mitigated

       The Risk Owner will systematically track the risks identified in the Risk
       Management Register. Risk Treatment would be monitored periodically.

       Risk Management report would be generated and presented to SLT on periodic
       basis

       DA/PMO/Information Security Team verify status of implementation of Risk
       Treatment and Contingency plans

       As Risk Management is an ongoing basis, New risks would be identified and the
       same would be assessed and monitored in the Risk Management register
       periodically

       The Risk Owner/ will capture lessons learned for future risk assessment using
       Risk Database I.e. History of Risks




  8.5 Identification of Opportunities
       Identify any opportunities Opportunity to be explored (wherever applicable)
       from the uncertainty, treat them as appropriate and monitor them



9. Process Description – Asset Risk Management
  Risk identification is an on-going activity for all the assets Risks will be identified basis
  the inputs from all stakeholders

  Risks would be updated in Weekly PMO Tool/Risk and Opportunity Management
  Module and monitored by PMO /DA and Infosec Team on periodic basis.

  Risks would be identified based on the impact that would be created on Information
  Security including Cloud Security and Data Privacy.

The details associated with each risk are filled in the Risk Management Register

•     The risk owner as a “person or entity with the accountability and authority to
      manage a risk.”

•     Asset owner to be identified and is the one who would be responsible for
      protecting the Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability & Privacy (C, I, A, P) of the
      asset.

•     Calculate Asset value based on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability and Privacy
      values

•     If Asset value is greater than (>=) 81 then perform ‘Risk Assessment’

•     Identify Threats, Existing Controls, Vulnerabilities, Impact and probability of
      occurrence of vulnerabilities.

•     Risk Magnitude is calculated based on the Impact value and Probability value

•     If Risk Magnitude is greater than (>=81) risk should be treated or transferred

      Note: Asset ownership is closer to operational control and risk ownership is more
      in relation with business risk.

•     Risk assessment methodology is explained in the below sections:




9.1 Identification Asset Category and Types
        Asset identification will be done based on the asset category; assets are
        classified as following categories:

            •   Information Assets: Databases and data files, Contracts and
                agreements, System documentation, Research information, User
                manuals, Training material, Operational or support procedures, Business
                continuity plans, Fall-back arrangements, Audit trails, and Archived
                information
            •   Software Assets: Application software, System software, Development
                tools, and Utilities, Software Licenses
            •   Physical/Hardware Assets/Infra Assets: Computer equipment,
                Communications equipment, Removable media, and Other equipment
            •   Services: Computing and communications services, General utilities (e.g.
                heating, lighting, power, and air-conditioning)

    TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                           12
         •     Human Resources: Employees (Qualifications, Skills, and Experience)
         •     Assets of similar functionality under each category will be taken up to
               identify assets that are identical in functionality and nature.




9.2 Identification of CIAP values and Calculation of Asset Value
For identified assets provide confidentiality, integrity availability and privacy values

         •     Confidentiality: Property that information is not made available or
               disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes
         •     Integrity: Property of protecting the accuracy and completeness of
               assets
         •     Availability: Property of being accessible and usable upon demand by
               an authorized entity
         •     Privacy: Property of protecting the information about an individual or
               group to seclude themselves and thereby express themselves selectively
               (When something is private to a person, it usually means that something
               is inherently special or sensitive to them)



Following tables will be used to assign the confidentiality, Integrity, Availability and

9.3 Risk Assessment Methodology
     • Identify ‘Threats’ for each asset type such as Fire, Flood, Theft,
       Building/Structure Collapse, Water Leakage, Non-Availability of Resources such
       as associates, software/hardware etc.
     • Refer list of threats in Appendix A: List of Threats
     • Identify ‘Existing Controls’ for threats
     • Identify and map applicable ‘Vulnerabilities’ to threats
     • Refer list of vulnerabilities in Appendix B: List of Vulnerabilities
     • Refer Mapping of Vulnerabilities to Threats in Appendix C: Mapping of
       Vulnerabilities to Threats
     • A list of threats will be maintained and updated as necessary.




9.4 Risk acceptance level
     • If assets having risk value as (<) less than 81, then those risks are considered as
       acceptable risks
     • If assets having risk value (>=) greater than 81, then it the risk should be
       considered and must be treated with adequate control implementation




9.5 Risk treatment
     • Treatment of risk will be undertaken subject to the following conditions:
     • If risk value is greater than (>=) 81 and above the risk will be treated or
       transferred



 TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                         15
    • Subsequent to the above, Vulnerabilities will be identified for the identified
      assets
    • Against the vulnerabilities identified for each asset, a set of threats that can
      exploit the vulnerabilities will then be identified.
    • Based on threat, vulnerabilities and existing controls, provide values for
      ‘Impact’ and ‘Probability’
    • Probability is the measure of the likelihood that a threat will be able to exploit a
      given Vulnerability
    • Impact is the measure of the adversity of a security event that can be
      described in terms of loss or degradation of any, or a combination of any, of
      the four security goals - CIAP (confidentiality, Integrity, availability and Privacy)
    • The function of Impact * Probability gives risk magnitude
    • For all risks, where risk magnitude > 27, considered as high and mitigation
      plan(s)/Security Controls shall be implemented
    • Based on the risk magnitude, Risk Handling Options will be selected
    • Risk Handling Options will be ‘Avoid Risk’, ‘Accept Risk’, ‘Transfer Risk’ and ‘Treat
      Risk’
    • On implementation of proposed controls, provide impact and probability
      values
    • The risk magnitude i.e. product of Impact & Probability gives residual risk after
      implementing the controls
    • Residual risks shall be verified for the acceptable levels of risk magnitude < =9
    • The respective project manager and/or the Function Head will be the owner of
      risk.
    • Information security and Business continuity risks shall be identified and
      recorded in the PM workbook /PMO Tool
    • Respective project level risks shall be reviewed as part of the PM & DM Reviews
      and DA Check Points and Toll Gates.
    • Report of high risk items, if any, shall be presented in the SMR by the PM.
    • A consolidated report of high risk items shall be presented in QBR by PMO.

  9.6 Review of risk assessment

       9.6.1 Risk assessment, risk acceptance level and residual risks
             are reviewed yearly once, taking into account changes to:
             • The organization

             • Technology

             • Business objectives and processes

             • Identified threats

             • Effectiveness of the implemented controls

             • External events, such as changes to the legal or regulatory environment,
               changed contractual obligations, and changes in social climate

             • The below factors are also considered during risk assessment:

                     o Addition/deletion/changes in assets

                     o Results of BCP tests

                     o Vulnerability assessment and

                      Penetration test results

                     o Information security incidents

                      occurred
