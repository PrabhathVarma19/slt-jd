1. Introduction
  Secure SDLC is a systematic approach and structures concepts to include
   security at every phase of software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It ensures the
   security assurance of specific activities including architecture analysis, code
   review, and penetration testing, all of which are integral aspects of the
   development effort.


  1.1 Objective(s)
   The secure software development life cycle is a step-by-step procedure to
   develop software with several objectives, including:

TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                       4
    • Awareness of security considerations by stakeholders.

    • Early detection of flaws in the system.

    • Optimizing the design, deployment, and maintenance of said software.

    • Cost reduction as a result of early detection and resolution of issues.

    • Overall reduction of intrinsic business risks for the organization.


   1.2 Scope
    The scope includes all internal and applicable vendor applications that are
    owned, operated, maintained, and controlled by Trianz by Internally and Externally
    either on premises or on cloud.



2. Secure SDLC Lifecycle
Secure software development includes integrating security in different phases of the

software development lifecycle such as requirements, design, implementation, testing

and decommissioning. It includes seven phases starting from providing awareness

training, secure requirements, planning and design, secure implementation and

coding, validation and security review. The Secure SDLC response applied to all project

methodology followed, waterfall , agile or Devops.

The way security is embedded within each phase is as illustrated in the below

diagram:




 TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                    5
  2.1 Security Training:
  •   All Trianz employees receive internal security training. Individuals in technical

      roles (Architect, developers, and program managers) who are directly involved

      with the development of software programs must attend at least one unique

      security training class annually.

  •   Project team members are strongly encouraged to seek additional security and

      privacy education that is appropriate to their needs or products.



  2.2 Requirements:
  •   Ensure security requirements must cover both functional security and Non-

      Functional Requirements are captured from the contractual obligation tracker.

  •   Ensure security requirements produce:

          •   misuse cases that depict non-malicious (intentional or unintentional)

              and

          •   Abuse cases that depict malicious (Intentional) threat based on

              inaccurate risk assessment/attack models.

TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                     6
  •   Ensure all security requirements are captured with respect to CIAP

      (confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy) and AAA (authentication,

      authorization, and accountability)

  •   Ensure tracking and documenting attack surfaces and any changes made to

      them during the development process.

  •   Threat modeling is carried out by which threats to the applications are

      discovered so they can be mitigated during implementation phase.

  •   The security & Privacy requirements need to be complied with legal and

      industry compliance requirements as ISO 27001, ISO 27701, ISO 27017/18, SOC, PCI

      DSS, HIPAA etc.



  2.3 Planning and Design:
  •   Ensure Performing a Risk Analysis, or a Threat Modelling in order to ensure that

      all the security requirements and specifications are enough to protect against

      the threats identified in the threat or risk models.

  •   Ensure following appropriate secure-design principles as per the technology in
      use.

  •   Ensure developing security blueprint and select the technologies needed to
      support security blueprint.

  •   At this phase, a Security Testing Plan shall be developed based on the threats
      identified during Threat Modelling or Risk Analysis exercise

  •   Ensure examining legal issues.

  •   Ensure planning incident response section and business response to disasters.

  •   Check for vulnerabilities in any feature of the application.

  •   Ensure the Controls and remediation against the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities,

      CWE/SANS top 25 programming errors that would be applicable as per

      technologies are in place.

TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                     7
  2.4 Secure Code:
  •   Ensuring that code is developed securely and implementing the security

      controls identified during the design phase.

  •   Ensure following OWASP top 10 secure coding standards/guidelines and

      perform code review to all source code. It is essential to review the code and

      identify bugs through secure code review software such as SonarQube.

  •   Use the latest compiler and supporting tool versions.

  •   secure software is to minimize the number of unintentional code-level security

      vulnerabilities. This can be achieved by

          •   Defining coding standards,

          •   Selecting the most appropriate (and safe) languages, frameworks, and

              libraries,



  2.5 Validation:
  •   Ensure that security criteria are included in every test case. Use the

      misuse/abuse scenarios as the basis for defining the test case strategy.

  •   Use the risk analysis to prioritize the tests to be performed, testing the highest

      risk/highest consequence items first.

  •   Ensure performing Fuzz testing. Fuzz tests all file formats and parser per format,

      each parser must be tested separately.

  •   Ensure testing includes DAST (Dynamic Analysis Security Testing) tools like Burp

      suite, Aqua Enforcer tool to test your application while in runtime. These tools

      can detect errors associated with user authentication, authorization, SQL

      injection, and API-related endpoints.

  •   Ensure performing vulnerability assessment, infrastructure assessment and

      penetration test (for all public facing applications) on the application. These


TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                      8
      tools can detect errors associated with (Weak Credentials, Injection Attacks,

      Buffer Overflows, Cross-site Scripting, etc.) and Pentest has been used to test

      networks, host operating system configurations, and patch levels.

  •   Reevaluate the attack surface of the software during the testing.



  2.6 Review and Release
  •   Ensure performing security code reviews for all high-priority code identified.

  •   The code review can be either manual or automated using technologies such
      as static application security testing (SAST).

  •   All threat models have been reevaluated and updated (or, for very old

      components or products, threat models have been created for all

      components).

  •   The attack surface has been reanalyzed, and the appropriateness of the default

      attack surface has been confirmed.

  •   Ensure before releasing the application, security review and employ security

      analysis tools to perform thorough penetration testing and vulnerability

      scanning.

  •   After completing all the necessary tests in runtime, send a secure build to

      production for final deployment.

  •   Ensure access restrictions are compliant as per below controls:

  •   Restrict the access to the application is only via like user identity specific IPs and

      block the application accessing from public IPs.

  •   Application is authenticated via Azure SSO or AD integration with MFA enabled.

  •   Deploy Web Application Firewall and harden the rules to protection mode.

  •   Ensure the application is being monitored for any security incidents and alerted.

  •     Ensure the security incidents are logged and incident management procedure

        is followed.
