  1. Introduction
      This process addresses the need to have a process approach towards
      acquiring a new system/product supporting various business processes in an
      organization. This process details the various steps to be performed while
      acquiring a COTS software product/application/system.

  2. Objective(s)
      •    Reduce system failure rate in real time environment through
           acquisition of systems/products systematically.
      •    Reduce the probability of unexpected system failures.
      •    Reduce the cost of ownership.

  3. Scope
      This process is applicable to all systems/products acquired to support
      the business processes at Trianz.

  6. Process Description

   6.1 System Acquisition Planning
       The step initiates the system acquisition process with the definition. Project
       definition defines the main constraints of the system acquisition project such
       as time, budget, and project type. Managerial definitions define the review
       boards, the stakeholders, and the pilot group of the project.

       Once the project and managerial definitions are defined, functional and non-
       functional requirements are developed from the original problem description
       in the form of user requirements, Use cases, Test Plan, quality requirements,
       technical requirements

   6.2 Analysis
   The analysis step shall involve the following procedures,
        • Develop an estimate of the custom development effort (in-house)
          •   Identify Vendors
          •   RFP
          •   Testing

   6.3 Evaluation of system
       This step shall involve final evaluation of the system in order to choose the
       product. This includes an overall evaluation based on the analysis of the
       demonstration products from identified Vendors. Once the evaluation is over,
       feedback shall be sought from relevant stakeholders and a decision on the
       selection of product shall be taken.
       For evaluation of tools, please refer Tool Evaluation Process.

   6.4 Purchase
      Once the vendor is chosen, the following procedures shall be followed,
           • Technical and Commercial Negotiation
              •   Purchase Order/Purchase Contract
              •   Identify additional customization requirements

   6.5 System Modification and Customization
      Once the COTS product is purchased, the acquirer and the vendor shall work
      together to ensure customization and modification activities happen as per
      plan. The modified product shall be tested against the test plan to check
      conformity to the product requirements. The following sub-practices shall be
      followed during the modification and customization,
              •   Planning
              •   Monitoring
              •   Testing

   6.6 Piloting
       During this step, the acquired system is deployed to a subset of the systems
       and tested by a subset of all the end user group members. This is executed in
       three phases.


       Definition: The acquirer of the system shall define the pilot group size, identify
       the pilot group members, and identify pilot test resources, steps to be followed
       by the pilot group, pilot test cases


       Evaluation: This involves execution of the pilot process steps, grading of the
       system against the defined criteria, identification of any further modifications,
       risks factors.


       Analysis: the acquirer of the system shall analyze the results out of evaluation;
       summarize the results in terms of defects/issues as major, minor, cosmetic. A
       major defect/issue is the miss which must be fixed but cannot be fixed easily.
       A minor defect/issue is a miss but can be fixed during or after deployment, A
       cosmetic defect/issue is a miss which should be fixed but does not result in a
       change.

   6.7 Deployment
      This step involves deployment of the acquired system into production
      environment. It involves the following sub-steps.
             •    Installation: The system is put into production through installation of
                  the acquired system.
             •    Data reporting: The deployment team shall provide data to the
                  acquirer about work performed, schedule, expenses, and problem
                  reports.

   6.8 Transition to Support
          Once the deployed system is stable and it is agreed upon by the
          management to transition the system into an operation/maintenance
          mode, the system in production is transitioned into a support group for
          maintaining the system through its life. The following sub-steps shall be
          followed during transition of the system to support team.
              •   Identify the Transition Team,

              •   Prepare a Transition Plan
              •   Obtain commitments from various stakeholders.
              •   Transition the system/product.
              •   Monitor and control the transition process.
              •   Generate Data report.
              •   Perform Transition sign off
