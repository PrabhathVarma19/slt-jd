1. Objectives
   The objective of this process is to ensure that changes are recorded in
   a controlled manner and the changes are evaluated, authorized,
   prioritized, planned, tested, implemented, and documented.

  ▪   Provide standardized methods, procedures for efficient and prompt
      handling of allchanges
  ▪   Record all changes to service assets and configuration items in the CMDB
  ▪   Respond to customer’s changing business requirements while
      maximizing valueand reducing incidents, disruption and rework
  ▪   Respond to the business and IT requests for change that will align the
      services withthe business needs




2. Scope
   This process applies to all Trianz users as well as to the third parties, and
   Trianz Information System resources.
   A change within the environment is any modification that has the potential to
   impact sharednetwork, computing or business applications by altering its
   existing state.

   This includes, but is not limited to:

  •   System Hardware
  •   System Software
  •   Business and Management Application or Service
  •   Databases




3. Introduction
   Service and infrastructure changes can have a negative impact through
   service disruption unless managed efficiently and effectively. Having an
   effective change management processadds value to the business by:
   ▪   Prioritizing and responding to business change proposals
   ▪   Contributing to meet governance, legal, contractual, and regulatory
       requirements
   ▪   Reducing failed changes and therefore service disruption, defects and rework
   ▪   Delivering changes promptly to meet business timescales
   ▪   Contributing to better estimations of quality, time and cost of change
   ▪   Assessing risks associated with the transition of services (introduction,
       modificationor disposal)




4. Entry Criteria
   RFC raised by authorized person



5. Inputs
   A Request for Change (RFC) is raised because of the identification of a
   ‘need for change’. Requests for change can come from any part of the
   organization and from any party contracted to provide services to that
   organization. All requests for change need appropriatesponsorship and
   authorization.

   A need for change will arise for a variety of reasons:

   •   Proactively, e.g. seeking business benefits such as reducing costs or
       improving services or increasing the ease and effectiveness of
       support.
   •   Reactively as a means of resolving errors and adapting to
       changingcircumstances, e.g. legislative or regulatory requirements.


6. Process Description
   This section describes the activities involved in the Change Management
   Process. These components are presented using the conventional
   Change Management framework – classification [initiation (justification),
   review (entitlement, evaluation), planning (Risk & Impact Analysis, Change
   design and development, plan preparation, scheduling), approval,
implementation (implementation and testing) and closure].

Changes are classified based on the following types:

1. Normal Change
2. Standard Change
3. Emergency Change




6.1 Normal Change Process
   The objective of Normal Change:
   • Standardized procedures are used for efficient and prompt
     handling ofnormal changes
   • To respond to the customer’s changing business
     requirements whilemaximizing value and reducing incidents,
     disruption and re-work
   • To respond to the business and IT requests for change that will
     align theservices with the business needs
   • To improve future changes by learning from previous
     mistakes andsuccesses

   Normal change is a change that meets established enterprise
   change management lead-time requirements. Normal changes
   will follow the completechange management process.By definition,
   a normal change will proceed through all steps of the change
   management process and will eventually be reviewed by the
   Change AdvisoryBoard (CAB) (changes with risk levels 4 and 5
   only).

   Examples of normal changes:
   • Software upgrades
   • Hardware upgrades
   • Application enhancements



6.2 Standard Change Process
   The objective of Standard Change are:
   • Standardized procedures are used for efficient and prompt
     handling of standardchanges
   • To respond to the customer’s changing business
     requirements while maximizingvalue and reducing incidents,
     disruption and re-work
   • To respond to the business and IT requests for change that
     will align the serviceswith the business needs
   • To improve future changes by learning from previous mistakes and
     successes
   • Any change that has an established and approved procedure
    for implementation; isrepeatable and can be implemented
    with minimum risk. The characteristics of a standard change
    are
     o Low risk and pre-approved AAA
     o Routine
     o Proven track record of success
     o Minimal complexity
     o Accepted change window
     o Approved standard operating procedure (SOP) for implementation

   The standard change needs to be approved only once. Each
   subsequent occurrencerequires a record but does not need
   approval.

   Examples:

    •   Install and rack new equipment
    •   Internet site maintenance
    •   Weekly reboots
    •   Building new servers
    •   Download and installation of Virus DAT files




6.3 Emergency Change Process
    Any change that has a high impact on business operations of
    the organization, is notoptional, and needs to be implemented
    immediately.
    Most emergency change requests will be linked to a corresponding incident
    record.
    An emergency change should not be used in order to bypass the
    appropriate lead-time.Documentation requirements for
     emergency changes are the same as any change.

     The change coordinator is responsible for meeting all requirements for the
     changedocumentation within one working day of the change
     implementation.
     Criteria for emergency change:
       • To resolve or prevent a major incident
       • To implement a critical security patch, ex: a virus outbreak
       • Any changes which are at risk level 1, 2 or 3 and requested
         lead time is lessthan one business day
       • Any changes which are at risk level 4 or 5 and requested
         lead time is lessthan eight business days



6.4 Post Implementation Review
Post implementation reviews are performed at two levels
• By change coordinator (for all risk levels)
• By Change Advisory Board (CAB) (for risk level 4,5 and all failed
  changes)

Once all the implementation activities are completed, the coordinator performs
the postimplementation review of all changes irrespective of risk levels

Post implementation review includes aspects of the change such as:
• Performance
• Security
• Functionality

➢ If the change is successful the change coordinator updates the
  change status as‘installed successfully’
➢ If the implementation of the change is not done as advertised,
  follow-up actions(including implementation of back out plan) will
  be implemented by the coordinator
➢ If the change fails the change coordinator updates the change status
  as ‘backed out’ or ‘installed with issues’ or ‘partially installed’ and
  documents the reasons forthe failure
➢ CAB performs the post implementation review on successful changes
  (risk levels4,5 only) and all failed changes as well

Note: For successful changes, which are at risk level 1, 2, and 3, the CAB will
notperform the Post Implementation Review (PIR)
   Optional: CAB may use Post Implementation Review (PIR) Report for conducting
   postimplementation review of major application and infrastructure changes

  11.1 Guidelines for Risk and Priority Assessment

     11.1.1   Risk Assessment
              Risk level is computed in the following two ways:
              • Risk assessment questionnaire
              • Configuration Item (CI) criticality
                  o By Environment – Production/QA/Testing/Dev
                  o Production – by business value of the CI
                  o QA/Testing/Dev – Each environment will have an associated risk
                    value
              The overall risk level for a particular change is equal to the greater of
              the above two values.


     11.1.2 Risk Assessment Questionnaire
              There are 5 risk levels and they are:
                • Level 1 (Minimal Risk)
                • Level 2 (Low Risk)
                • Level 3 (Medium Risk)
                • Level 4 (High Risk)
                • Level 5 (Extreme Risk)
              Risk involved in implementing a change will be based on the
              overall risk assessment score for a change. When a change
              coordinator completes the risk assessment questionnaire, the
              risk level is computed corresponding to the following
              guidelines:

              Overall Risk Level = ((Risk 1 * Weight 1) + (Risk 2 * Weight 2) +
              (Risk 3 * Weight 3) + --- +(Risk n * Weight n)) / (Weight 1 +
              Weight 2 + Weight 3 + --- + Weight n)
              The calculated risk does not result in a whole number. The
              results must be rounded off tothe next highest number.

              The logic here is that no risk should be downplayed. Any risk
              greater than the whole numbershould be shown as the next
              risk up.

              For example, 3.00001 becomes 4
               4.91 becomes 5
              The risk assessment questionnaire covers the following factors:
                                                     Weightage for
