## 1. Introduction
- Threat Intelligence (TI) involves obtaining and analyzing information about potential cyber threats to enhance defenses.
- TI is essential for Trianz to proactively identify, assess, and mitigate cybersecurity risks, enabling detection of emerging threats from global adversaries.

## 2. Objectives
- **Proactive Threat Identification**: Continuously gather intelligence to detect and analyze potential cyber threats before they impact the organization.
- **Risk Assessment & Prioritization**: Evaluate the severity and relevance of identified threats to prioritize response efforts based on risk levels.
- **Incident Response & Mitigation**: Provide actionable intelligence to improve incident response, containment, and mitigation efforts.
- **Continuous Monitoring & Reporting**: Regularly monitor the threat landscape and generate reports to inform stakeholders about emerging risks.
- **Regulatory Compliance & Governance**: Align the TI process with regulatory requirements and industry best practices to ensure compliance.

## 3. Scope
- This control applies to all systems, people, and processes within the organization’s information systems, including board members, directors, employees, suppliers, and third parties with access to Trianz systems.

## 4. Entry Criteria
- Access to reliable threat intelligence sources.
- Established tools and platforms for collecting and analyzing intelligence.
- Trained personnel with defined roles and responsibilities.

## 5. Inputs
- **Internal Sources**: Logs, incident reports, and security events.
- **External Sources**: 
  - Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
  - Commercial threat intelligence feeds
  - Regulatory bodies
  - Industry Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs)
- **Technical Sources**: Indicators of compromise (IoCs) such as:
  - Unusual outbound traffic
  - Abnormal DNS requests
  - Phishing email patterns
  - Suspicious attachments
  - Domains associated with cyber threats
  - Malware analysis reports
  - Vulnerability databases
  - Dark web monitoring

## 6. Process Description (Procedure)
- Threat intelligence is gathered and reported at three levels:
  1. **Strategic**: Focuses on high-level information about groups of attackers, their motivations, typical targets, types of attacks, and current activity levels.
  2. **Tactical**: Concerns specific attackers or types of attackers and their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used to gain access to systems or pose threats.
  3. **Operational**: Relates to specific and potentially ongoing attacks, including IoCs that may indicate a breach.

- **Direction/Planning**: 
  - Clear objectives must be defined for threat intelligence, considering the organization's context, including industry, locations, technology, and interested parties.

### 4. Sources of Intelligence
- Intelligence is gathered from various sources, including:
  - **Internal Sources**: Logs, incident reports, and security events.
  - **External Sources**: 
    - Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) such as Shodan, Maltego, the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and Open Threat Exchange (OTX).
    - Commercial threat intelligence feeds, regulatory bodies, and industry ISACs.
  - **Technical Sources**: Indicators of compromise (IoCs), malware analysis reports, vulnerability databases, and dark web monitoring.

- The information must be stored appropriately, and its source clearly recorded for future reference.

### 5. Processing and Analysis
- Collected intelligence is filtered, correlated, and validated for relevance.
- Threats are categorized based on their severity, impact, and likelihood.
- Analysis tools such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIP) are used to enrich intelligence data.

### 6. Dissemination and Reporting
- Threat intelligence reports are shared with relevant stakeholders.
- Critical threats are escalated immediately to the Incident Response Team.
- Regular briefings and updates are provided to senior management.

### 7. Response and Mitigation
- Security teams apply threat intelligence to improve monitoring, detection, and response.
- Action plans are developed to mitigate risks associated with identified threats.
- Changes to security controls, patches, or policies are implemented as necessary.

### 8. Continuous Improvement
- The effectiveness of the threat intelligence process is reviewed periodically.
- Lessons learned from incidents and threat trends are incorporated into the threat intelligence process.
- New intelligence sources and analytical tools are evaluated for potential integration.

### 9. Exit Criteria and Output
- Intelligence has been analyzed and disseminated.
- Relevant security controls have been implemented or updated.
- Reports have been provided to stakeholders, and mitigation actions have been taken.

### 10. Roles and Responsibilities
#### IS Operations Team (Internal)
- Collects and analyzes intelligence from internal and external sources.
- Monitors threat intelligence platforms, security feeds, and regulatory advisories.
- Reports relevant threats to stakeholders and recommends mitigation strategies.
- Utilizes threat intelligence to enhance incident detection and response.
- Coordinates with other teams to remediate and mitigate identified threats.
- Implements security controls based on intelligence findings.
- Assists in closing vulnerabilities associated with identified threats.

#### InfoSec & Data Privacy Assurance Team (Internal)
- Ensures that threat intelligence activities align with business and security objectives.
- Provides necessary resources and approves threat intelligence policies.

### 11. ISO Control Mapping(s)
- **Category of Control**: Organizational Control
  - **ISO 27001:2022 Control**: 5.7 Threat Intelligence Control
  - **Document Name as per ISO 27001:2022**: Threat Intelligence Procedure
- Information relating to information security threats shall be collected and analyzed.
