1. Introduction
  •   Threat Intelligence is a discipline of obtaining and analyzing information about
      those who would do us harm in cyber space to understand how to make our
      defenses as effective as possible.
  •   Threat Intelligence (TI) is crucial for Trianz to proactively identify, assess, and
      mitigate cybersecurity risks. By systematically collecting, analyzing, and
      reporting intelligence, Trianz can detect emerging threats, including those
      from global adversaries.



2. Objectives
  •   Proactive Threat Identification – Continuously gather intelligence to detect
      and analyze potential cyber threats before they impact the organization.
  •   Risk Assessment & Prioritization – Evaluate the severity and relevance of
      identified threats to prioritize response efforts based on risk levels.
  •   Incident Response & Mitigation – Provide actionable intelligence to enhance
      incident response, containment, and mitigation efforts.
  •   Continuous Monitoring & Reporting – Regularly monitor the threat landscape
      and generate reports to keep stakeholders informed about emerging risks.
  •   Regulatory Compliance & Governance – Align the TI process with regulatory
      requirements and industry best practices to ensure compliance.




3. Scope
  This Control applies to all systems, people and processes that constitute the
  organization’s information systems, including board members , directors ,
  employees, suppliers, and other 3rd party who has access to Trianz systems.



4. Entry Criteria
  •   Access to reliable threat intelligence sources.


TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                             4
  •   Established tools and platforms for collecting and analysing intelligence.
  •   Trained personnel with defined roles and responsibilities.



5. Inputs
  •   Internal sources: Logs, incident reports, and security events.

  •   External sources: OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence), commercial threat
      intelligence feeds, regulatory bodies, and industry ISACs.

  •   Technical sources: Indicators of compromise (IoCs) such as Unusual
      outbound traffic, abnormal DNS requests, Phishing email patterns, suspicious
      attachments, domains associated with cyber threats etc., malware analysis
      reports, vulnerability databases, and dark web monitoring.




6. Process Description (Procedure)
  In Accordance with our policy Threat intelligence is gathered and reported at
  three levels.

  1. Strategic:

      Focused on the collection and analysis of high-level information regarding
      groups of attackers, their motivation, typical targets, types of attack and
      current levels of activity.



  2. Tactical:
      Concerned with specific attackers or types of attackers and the tactics,
      techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that they are currently using to gain
      access to systems or otherwise pose a threat to our organization.


  3. Operational:
      Relating to specific and potentially ongoing attacks, including IOC’s which
      may allow us to identify cases where we have suffered a breach.

      This process is intended to be used in its basic form and below are the steps.




  4. Direction/Planning:


      It is important that clear objectives are defined for threat intelligence in
      general and for the specific topics for which information is to be collected and
      analyzed. These objectives should consider the context of the organization, in
      terms of our industry, locations, technology and interested parties.


      Collection:
      Threat intelligence is gathered from various sources, including:
          • Internal sources: Logs, incident reports, and security events.
          • External sources: OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) such as Shodan,
            Maltego, the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and Open Threat Exchange (OTX),
            commercial threat intelligence feeds, regulatory bodies, and industry
            ISACs.
          • Technical sources: Indicators of compromise (IoCs), malware analysis
            reports, vulnerability databases, and dark web monitoring.



      The information must be stored appropriately, and its source clearly recorded
      for future reference.


  5. Processing and Analysis
      •   Collected intelligence is filtered, correlated, and validated for relevance.
      •   Threats are categorized based on their severity, impact, and likelihood.
      •   Analysis tools such as SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
          and TIP (Threat Intelligence Platforms) are used to enrich intelligence data.
  6. Dissemination and Reporting
      •   Threat intelligence reports are shared with relevant stakeholders.
      •   Critical threats are escalated immediately to the Incident Response Team.
      •   Regular briefings and updates are provided to senior management.
  7. Response and Mitigation

      •   Security teams apply threat intelligence to improve monitoring, detection,
          and response.
      •   Action plans are developed to mitigate risks associated with identified
          threats.
      •   Changes to security controls, patches, or policies are implemented as
          necessary.
  8. Continuous Improvement
      •   The effectiveness of the threat intelligence process is reviewed periodically.
      •   Lessons learned from incidents and threat trends are incorporated into the
          TI process.
      •   New intelligence sources and analytical tools are evaluated for potential
          integration.



7. Exit Criteria and Output

  •   Intelligence has been analyzed and disseminated.
  •   Relevant security controls have been implemented or updated.
  •   Reports have been provided to stakeholders, and mitigation actions have
      been taken.
