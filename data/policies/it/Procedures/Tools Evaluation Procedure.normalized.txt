## 6. Process Description

### 6.1 Overview
- An Approved Tools List (ATL) is published in Pulse/Blue Book, listing all tools identified, evaluated, and approved for various activities under different circumstances.
- Upon identifying the need for a tool, the requestor must send an email request to tools.evaluation@trianz.com with the required details for evaluation.

### 6.2 Evaluation Requirement of a Tool in a Project
- The Project Manager (PM) identifies tools during the planning stage.
- The PM checks the ATL to see if the tool is already included.
- If the PM identifies a different tool with similar capabilities, they must request a comparative evaluation.
- If the tool is not in the ATL, the PM must request an evaluation for its use in the project.
- If there is an upgrade (change in version number) to a tool in the ATL, the PM must request an evaluation for its suitability.
- Tools available in the ATL will be adopted as is.
- The PM raises an email request to the Tools Review Committee for evaluation, providing necessary project details.

### 6.3 Evaluation Requirement of a Tool in the Organization
- The requestor must check the ATL to see if the tool is already included.
- If the requestor identifies a different tool with similar capabilities, they must request a comparative evaluation.

### 5.4 Tool Evaluation

- Upon receiving an email request for tool evaluation, the Tools Review Committee (TRC) Coordinator will identify members within the organization who have the necessary capabilities to evaluate the tool. At least one representative from IS Operations must be included in the evaluation team.
- The Requestor and TRC Coordinator (IT Manager) will provide the necessary inputs for the evaluation to the identified team members.
- The tool evaluation team will determine the evaluation method. The Requestor may assist in identifying the evaluation method if needed.
- The methods of evaluation may include:
  - Modeling and simulation
  - Engineering studies
  - Cost studies
  - Business opportunity studies
  - Surveys
  - Extrapolations based on prototypes
  - User review and comment
  - Testing
  - Expert judgment (e.g., Delphi Method)
  - Pugh Matrix and weighted average
  - **Note:** Refer to DAR guidelines for Pugh Matrix and Weighted Average Methods.
- The IT Representative will conduct a security check for malicious code in the tools, which includes viruses, worms, Trojan Horses, and attack scripts.
- The Requestor will prepare the tool evaluation report. The IT team will perform the security check using security tools and share the system-generated results along with the tool evaluation report with the TRC.
- Upon completion of the evaluation, the tool evaluation team will submit the evaluation report to the TRC Coordinator (IT Manager).
- If major upgrades to the tool are released, the TRC will conduct a re-evaluation upon request to assess the suitability of the upgraded tool for the project/organization. The report will be shared with the Requestor and the InfoSec and Data Privacy Assurance Team (ISDPA).
- The approval authority for any tool is the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).
- **Note:** Refer to Appendix A for General Criteria for Evaluation of a Tool.

### 5.5 Publication of ATL
