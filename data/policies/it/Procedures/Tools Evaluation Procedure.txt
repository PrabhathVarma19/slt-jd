1. Introduction
   All tools proposed to be used in projects/organization are evaluated for
   applicability. The Tools Review Committee coordinates for evaluating tools on
   request and recommends for specific use.


       1.1 Objective(s)
             Maintain ‘approved tools list’ of all the tools which are used in
             organization.

             Evaluate tools before use in project/organization to ensure suitability
             and applicability.



             Verify for any malicious code in the tool Scope.

             The process is applicable for project specific tools, product specific
             tools used for engineering, engineering support and project
             management activities and tools used at organization level.

               Tool identified for use in a project, either at initiation or during project
               execution
               Tool identified for use in organization

4. Inputs

               Request for evaluation
               Project Initiation Form
               Project Plan
               Approved Tools List

5. Process Description


         5.1      Overview

               An Approved Tools List is published in Pulse/Blue Book The ATL lists all
               the tools identified, evaluated and approved for use for various activities
               under different circumstances.
               On identifying the need for a tool in a project/organization, requestor sends
               an email request to tools.evaluation@trianz.com providing the required
               details to carry out the evaluation.

      5.2      Evaluation Requirement of a Tool in a Project

               The Project Manager during the planning stage identifies the tools that
               would be used in the project
               On identifying a tool, PM refers to the ATL to check if it is already included
               in the ATL
               If the PM has identified a different tool with the same capabilities of the tool
               available in the ATL, requests for a comparative evaluation to identify the
               tool that best fits the project requirement
               If the tool is not available in the ATL, PM requests for an evaluation of the
               tool for use in the project
               If there is an upgrade (change in version number) to the tool available in the
               ATL, the PM asks for an evaluation for suitability to the project
               Tools used in the organization are available in the ATL will be adopted as
               is
               PM raises an email request to the Tools Review Committee for evaluation
               of the tool by providing the details as required by the project

      5.3    Evaluation Requirement of a Tool in the organization

             On identifying a tool, Requestor refers to the ATL to check if it is already
             included in the ATL
             If the requestor has identified a different tool with the same capabilities of
             the tool available in the ATL, requests for a comparative evaluation to
             identify the tool that best fits the organization requirement.
             If the tool is not available in the ATL, Requestor requests for an evaluation
             of the tool for use in the organization.
             If there is an upgrade (change in version number) to the tool available in the
             ATL, Requestor asks for an evaluation for suitability.
             Tools used in the organization are available in the ATL will be adopted as
             is.
             Requestor raises an email request to the Tools Review Committee for
             evaluation of the tool by providing the details as required by the
             organization.

      5.4    Tool Evaluation

             On receiving the email request for evaluation, the Tools Review Committee
             Coordinator identifies member (s) in the organization with the capabilities to
             evaluate the tool, and minimum one representative from IS Operations is
             mandatory in the evaluation team
             Requestor and TRC Coordinator (IT Manager) provides inputs required to
             carry out the evaluation to the identified members
             The Tool evaluation team members arrive at a method for evaluation. The
             requestor may be involved in identifying the evaluation method, if required.
             The methods of evaluation include the Modeling and simulation,
             Engineering studies, Cost studies, Business opportunity studies, Surveys,
             Extrapolations based on prototypes, User review and comment, Testing,
             Judgment provided by an expert or group of experts (e.g., Delphi Method),
             Pugh Matrix and weighted average
             •    Refer: DAR guidelines for Pugh Matrix and Weighted Average Methods

             IT Representative will perform security check for malicious code in tools
             (malicious code include viruses, worms, Trojan Horses, and attack
             script...etc)
             Tool evaluation report will be prepared by requestor, IT team will perform
             security check using security tools and share the system generated results
             along with tool evaluation report to tool Review committee
             On completion of evaluation, Tool evaluation team submits the evaluation
             report to the TRC Coordinator (IT Manager)

             •    Refer to Tool Evaluation Report Template

             If there are major upgrades to the Tool released, TRC on request gets re-
             evaluation done to check the suitability of the upgraded tool for the
             project/organization and shares the report with the requestor and InfoSec
             and Data Privacy Assurance Team (ISDPA)
                       Approval authority for any tool is CISO (Chief information security
             officer)
             •    Refer to Appendix A for General Criteria for Evaluation of a Tool




      5.5        Publication of ATL

             The TRC Coordinator (IT Manager) provides the updated ATL to Assurance
             Team
             Refer to Approve Tools List Template
             InfoSec and Data Privacy Assurance Team (ISDPA) publishes the ATL to
             all the employees through Pulse/Blue Book

      5.6    Feedback and Effectiveness of Tool Usage

             On completion of a project, TRC coordinator (IT Manager) collects the
             feedback on tool usage in the project and update ‘Feedback from Users’
             column in ATL
             TRC plans for a review of the ATL and TRC Coordinator (IT Manager)
             updates the ATL based on the review and sends updated ATL to InfoSec
             and Data Privacy Assurance Team (ISDPA) for publishing in Pulse/Blue
