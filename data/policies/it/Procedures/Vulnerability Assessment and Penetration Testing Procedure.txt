6.2 Vulnerability Assessment
      •       Vulnerabilities are identified at infrastructure and network level by running tools viz.,
              Nessus and Burpsuite with latest versions.

      •       For PCI-specific environments, perform vulnerability scans on internal/external IP
              addresses; use an Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) and track findings through
              remediation.

      •       Alerts and threats published by OEMs and certified agencies.

      •       Alerts and threats published by SANS, OWASP, NVD and CVSS is helpful to find
              vulnerability.

      •       Before proceeding with Vulnerability Assessment, the scope of the assessment to be
              clearly defined. The scope is based on the asset inventory to be assessed.

      •       The Vulnerability Assessment process is divided into three phases:
              o     Pre-Assessment Phase (Information Gathering)
              o     Assessment Phase (Detection, Analysis and Remediation)
              o     Post Assessment Phase (Reporting and Monitor)




  6.3 Pre- Assessment Phase (Information Gathering)
          ▪       VA team should gather information about the asset inventory as pre-requisites. The
                  following information to be collected as minimum.
          ▪       Network architecture view e.g. MPLS, VLAN.
          ▪       Security appliance configuration like IDS, IPS, and UTM
          ▪       Switches, Routers, Web proxies and Firewall configurations.
          ▪       IP addresses of on premises and on cloud appliances
          ▪       Operating System version.
          ▪       Identify the critical assets

        ▪   Application details in case of Projects
        ▪   Roles and Responsibilities of Associates
        ▪   Security configuration of Website (e.g. security certificate, services running)


6.4 Assessment Phase (Detection, Analysis and Remediation)
     Detection: After the finalization of devices and assets are to be assessed for the
     existence of vulnerabilities; the next step is to execute the selected tool.

 •   The actual execution of the tool shall be done as per the ‘day-wise’ and ‘resource-wise’
     plan detailed in the asset inventory.

 •   Further to the above, the tool like Nessus, Burp Suite is used to find the vulnerabilities of
     assets as per in the asset inventory.

 •   The vulnerability like misconfiguration of patches, OS version and configuration of network
     architecture is to be segregated as per asset inventory.

 •   On the VA scanner ensure that discovery scanning is enabled to identify the new
     Information Assets connected to the Trianz network

 •   Mandatory VA scanning shall be conducted for all the information Assets before
     accessing the Trianz network.

 •   Associates travelling from high-risk geo locations with the Trianz Informational Assets
     (e.g. Laptop), ensure mandatory VA scanning shall be conducted post travel on the
     information Assets before connecting to the Trianz network.


     Analysis: Analyze and prioritize the activity as per the criticality and impact of the
     vulnerability. The analysis of vulnerability is to be calculated based on the CVSS score.
     Analyze the vulnerabilities as per the best practice:
 ▪   Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
 ▪   Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE)


     Vulnerability Severity Rating: The severity of vulnerability is to be checked as per the
     asset inventory in risk register. Refer to Risk Management Procedure
     Remediation: Vulnerabilities are remediated in accordance with calendar and further
     revalidations are done to ensure closure. Remediation will be done by Assets owner and
     review will be carried out by CIO/CISO prior to approval.

6.5 Post Assessment Phase (Reporting and Monitor):
       Reporting: Convert the final list of rated vulnerabilities into a separate VA report. This
       report should include vulnerabilities, affected assets, server details, vulnerability ratings,
       recommendations for fixes, best practices.
       Prepare a management summary report of vulnerability assessment
       Share the report with respective teams.


       A management report containing the server details, vulnerabilities, rating and
       recommendations. It should also contain management summary for the findings in the VA
       assessment


       Monitoring: The Vulnerability assessment must be monitored continuously as per the
       VAPT Report evaluation checklist.


6.6 Penetration Testing
       Penetration testing checks the system’s ability to protect its networks, applications,
       endpoints and users from external or internal threats based on vulnerabilities. It also
       protects the security controls and ensures only authorized access as per rule set.
       Penetration testing is essential because:

       •   Check the infrastructure before the hacker attacks the infrastructure.

       •   Evaluate the efficiency of network security devices such as firewalls, routers, and Web
           servers

       •   To ensure the applications, products are not released with Vulnerabilities




 TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                                        11
      In addition to this, Penetration Testing should be performed once in a year by a third party
      or whenever:

      •     Security system discovers new threats by attackers.

      •     Upgradation to the new system or install new software or set up a new end-user
            program/policy

      •     Any system or software before it is deployed to production.




6.7 Process of Penetration Testing
  •       Planning & Preparation: Planning and preparation starts with defining the goals and
          objectives of the penetration testing. Penetration testing has been assigned to IS Team/
          Project Team and/or an external party. The broad sets of responsibilities are as defined
          in Table –Section” Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing Process.”

  •       Reconnaissance: Reconnaissance includes an Assessment of the preliminary
          information and obtain a complete and detailed information of the systems.



      •    Discovery: use automated tools to scan target assets for discovering vulnerabilities.


      ▪    Network Discovery: Such as discovery of additional systems, servers, and other
           devices (core servers, domain controllers, e-mail platforms, ERP, and ERM systems,
           etc.)
      ▪    Host Discovery: It discovers open ports on these devices
      ▪    Service Running: It probes ports to discover actual services which are running on
           them.



      •     Analyzing Information and Risks: Analyzes and assesses the information gathered
            before the test steps for dynamically penetrating the system. Based on the
            Information and risk assessment, assess the following points.
             ▪   The defined goals of the penetration test
             ▪   The potential risks to the system


  •       Active Intrusion Attempts: This is the most important step that must be performed with
          due care. This step must be performed when a verification of potential vulnerabilities is
          needed.


TRIANZ INTERNAL                                                                                    12
  •     Final Assessment: This step primarily considers all the steps conducted (discussed
        above) till that time and an evaluation of the vulnerabilities present in the form of
        potential risks.



  •     Report Preparation: Report preparation must start with overall testing procedures,
        followed by an Assessment of vulnerabilities and risks. The high risks and critical
        vulnerabilities must have priorities and then followed by the lower order.




6.8 Phases of Penetration Testing Methodology
  •     Before proceeding to the phases, all parties should be aware of the scope, types of
        testing (internal or external), rules of engagement, documentation, success criteria,
        review of past threats and vulnerabilities, awareness and education, tools to be used
        and avoid scan on security appliances.

  •     The phases of Penetration testing methodology are divided in three steps:
      Pre- Attack Phase

  •     Information gathering of all the Physical and logical infrastructure of the organization,
        Analog connections including phone lines, fax lines, dialup lines, and other out-of-band
        connectivity, other information that has the potential to result in a possible exploitation.
  Passive Reconnaissance
        ▪   Finding the directory structures of Web servers and services
        ▪   Gathering competitive intelligence over social media.
        ▪   Social engineering about the Infrastructure.
  Active Reconnaissance
        ▪   Network mapping: Find the network architecture through server domain or by
            directory structure.
        ▪   Perimeter mapping: Traceroute the Network gateway to define the outer network
            layer and switches, routers and firewall configuration.
        ▪   System and service identification through port scans: identify live systems and
            IP addresses, port states (open, closed, or filtered), protocols used (routing or
            tunneled), active services and service types, OS fingerprinting, version identification,
            internal IP addressing, etc.
        ▪   Web profiling: All Web-based forms, types of user input, and form-submission
            destinations, comments field etc.
